# Skip-Thought-Paraphrasing

This the repository for the research paper "A Comparison of Neural Network Architectures for Unsupervised Paraphrase Generation".

### About the Project

This paper introduces the usage of noised Skip-Thought encoders for stochastic unsupervised paraphrase generation compared to traditional approaches.  The paper itself is contained in the "Final Paper" pdf and a poster from our presentation at St. Olaf College is available under the "Final Poster" pdf.
