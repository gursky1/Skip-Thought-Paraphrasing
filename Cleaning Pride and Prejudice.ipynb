      " It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?” Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.” Mr. Bennet made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.” This was invitation enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.” “What is his name?” “Bingley.” “Is he married or single?” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Single, my dear, to be sure!\n",
      "\n",
      "A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a fine thing for our girls!” “How so?\n",
      "\n",
      "How can it affect them?” “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome!\n",
      "\n",
      "You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.” “Is that his design in settling here?” “Design!\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonsense, how can you talk so!\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.” “I see no occasion for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.” “My dear, you flatter me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.” “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.” “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.” “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.” “But consider your daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.” “You are over-scrupulous, surely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.” “I desire you will do no such thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you are always giving her the preference.” “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.” “Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\n",
      "\n",
      "You take delight in vexing me.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have no compassion for my poor nerves.” “You mistake me, my dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a high respect for your nerves.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are my old friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.” “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.” “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.” “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.” “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.” Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mind was less difficult to develop.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\n",
      "\n",
      "The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was then disclosed in the following manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with: “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.” “We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.” “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.” “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has two nieces of her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.” “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.” Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake!\n",
      "\n",
      "Have a little compassion on my nerves.\n",
      "\n",
      "You tear them to pieces.” “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.” “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?” “To-morrow fortnight.” “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.” “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her.” “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?” “I honour your circumspection.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.\n",
      "\n",
      "One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if we do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.” The girls stared at their father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense, nonsense!” “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot quite agree with you there.\n",
      "\n",
      "What say you, Mary?\n",
      "\n",
      "For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.” Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.” “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before?\n",
      "\n",
      "If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.” The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I knew I should persuade you at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, how pleased I am!\n",
      "\n",
      "and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.” “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.” “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest.” The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "They attacked him in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her report was highly favourable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William had been delighted with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could be more delightful!\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.” In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a contrast between him and his friend!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\n",
      "\n",
      "His character was decided.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "You had much better dance.” “I certainly shall not.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.” “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a kingdom!\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.” “You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.” “Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.\n",
      "\n",
      "You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.” Mr. Bingley followed his advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "They found Mr. Bennet still up.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had rather hoped that his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish you had been there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice!\n",
      "\n",
      "Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her twice!\n",
      "\n",
      "and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so vexed to see him stand up with her!\n",
      "\n",
      "But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger--” “If he had had any compassion for me,” cried her husband impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much!\n",
      "\n",
      "For God's sake, say no more of his partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "my dear, I am quite delighted with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is so excessively handsome!\n",
      "\n",
      "And his sisters are charming women.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown--” Here she was interrupted again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him!\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not handsome enough to dance with!\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I quite detest the man.”   When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!” “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.\n",
      "\n",
      "His character is thereby complete.” “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not expect such a compliment.” “Did not you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I did for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that is one great difference between us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never.\n",
      "\n",
      "What could be more natural than his asking you again?\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "No thanks to his gallantry for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have liked many a stupider person.” “Dear Lizzy!” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "You never see a fault in anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life.” “I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think.” “I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!\n",
      "\n",
      "Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Their manners are not equal to his.” “Certainly not--at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.” Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In understanding, Darcy was the superior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had several children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were Mr. Bingley's first choice.” “Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he did--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr. Robinson.” “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest?\n",
      "\n",
      "and his answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "'” “Upon my word!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.” “My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,” said Charlotte.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just tolerable.” “I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.” “Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.” “Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to.” “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances.\n",
      "\n",
      "With them he is remarkably agreeable.” “I do not believe a word of it, my dear.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.” “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.” “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with him, if I were you.” “I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him.” “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud.” “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.” “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously.\n",
      "\n",
      "A person may be proud without being vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.” “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.” “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.” The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visit was soon returned in due form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest.\n",
      "\n",
      "By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.\n",
      "\n",
      "She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can all begin freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In nine cases out of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.” “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.” “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.” “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.” “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.” “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.\n",
      "\n",
      "As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has known him only a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.” “Not as you represent it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal.” “Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.” “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.” “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.” Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\n",
      "\n",
      "He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "His doing so drew her notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?” “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.” “But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.” On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said: “Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?” “With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic.” “You are severe on us.” “It will be her turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.” “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!\n",
      "\n",
      "If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I shall keep mine to swell my song.” Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began: “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing like dancing after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society.” “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every savage can dance.” Sir William only smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your friend performs delightfully,” he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.” “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.” “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you often dance at St. James's?” “Never, sir.” “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?” “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.” “You have a house in town, I conclude?” Mr. Darcy bowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.” He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her: “My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William: “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.” Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.” “Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a partner?” Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley: “I can guess the subject of your reverie.” “I should imagine not.” “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was never more annoyed!\n",
      "\n",
      "The insipidity, and yet the noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people!\n",
      "\n",
      "What would I give to hear your strictures on them!” “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mind was more agreeably engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.” Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity: “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.” “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am all astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you joy?” “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew you would be wishing me joy.” “Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.” He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before.\n",
      "\n",
      "They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.\n",
      "\n",
      "After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed: “From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.” Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I wished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however.” “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.” “Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.” “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.” “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals.” “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.” Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, “Well, Jane, who is it from?\n",
      "\n",
      "What is it about?\n",
      "\n",
      "What does he say?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.” “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“MY DEAR FRIEND,-- “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a quarrel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come as soon as you can on receipt of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever, “CAROLINE BINGLEY” “With the officers!” cried Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.” “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.” “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.” “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.” “I had much rather go in the coach.” “But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?” “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.” “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother's purpose will be answered.” She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth: “MY DEAREST LIZZY,-- “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better.\n",
      "\n",
      "They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.--Yours, etc.” “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not afraid of her dying.\n",
      "\n",
      "People do not die of little trifling colds.\n",
      "\n",
      "She will be taken good care of.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as she stays there, it is all very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.” Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "She declared her resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt!\n",
      "\n",
      "You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.” “I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.” “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the horses?” “No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall be back by dinner.” “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.” “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.” In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth silently attended her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was by no means better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.\n",
      "\n",
      "His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had very little notice from any but him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added: “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall never forget her appearance this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "She really looked almost wild.” “She did, indeed, Louisa.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could hardly keep my countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very nonsensical to come at all!\n",
      "\n",
      "Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?\n",
      "\n",
      "Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!” “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.” “Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was all lost upon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.” “You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition.” “Certainly not.” “To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!\n",
      "\n",
      "What could she mean by it?\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.” “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.” “Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again: “I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.” “I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.” “Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.” “That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.” “But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.” “Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.” “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.” “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.” Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying.\n",
      "\n",
      "He immediately offered to fetch her others--all that his library afforded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into.” Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left so small a collection of books.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!” “It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many generations.” “And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.” “I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.” “Neglect!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.” “I wish it may.” “But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.” “With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.” “I am talking of possibilities, Charles.” “Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.” Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will she be as tall as I am?” “I think she will.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller.” “How I long to see her again!\n",
      "\n",
      "I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a countenance, such manners!\n",
      "\n",
      "And so extremely accomplished for her age!\n",
      "\n",
      "Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.” “It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.” “All young ladies accomplished!\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear Charles, what do you mean?” “Yes, all of them, I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses.\n",
      "\n",
      "I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.” “Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has too much truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.” “Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.” “Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with.\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.” “All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.” “I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.\n",
      "\n",
      "I rather wonder now at your knowing any.” “Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?” “I never saw such a woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.” Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.” “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, “there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.” Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.\n",
      "\n",
      "This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.\n",
      "\n",
      "They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.\n",
      "\n",
      "After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is a great deal too ill to be moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.” “Removed!” cried Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must not be thought of.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.” “You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, “that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.” Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with.\n",
      "\n",
      "I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.” “Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.” “That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "yes--I understand you perfectly.” “I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.” “That is as it happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.” “Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.” “I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a studier of character.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be an amusing study.” “Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have at least that advantage.” “The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.” “But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.” “Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town.” Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places.\n",
      "\n",
      "The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?” “When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.” “Aye--that is because you have the right disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing at all.” “Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true.” “Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.” Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, she called yesterday with her father.\n",
      "\n",
      "What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he?\n",
      "\n",
      "So much the man of fashion!\n",
      "\n",
      "So genteel and easy!\n",
      "\n",
      "He has always something to say to everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.” “Did Charlotte dine with you?” “No, she would go home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up very differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a pity they are not handsome!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that I think Charlotte so very plain--but then she is our particular friend.” “She seems a very pleasant young woman.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody better looking.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is what everybody says.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not trust my own partiality.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, however, he did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps he thought her too young.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.” “And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!” “I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,” said Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything nourishes what is strong already.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.” Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.\n",
      "\n",
      "She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.\n",
      "\n",
      "She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.\n",
      "\n",
      "His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear: “I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.” Lydia declared herself satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when you have given your ball,” she added, “I shall insist on their giving one also.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.” Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day passed much as the day before had done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The loo-table, however, did not appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!” He made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You write uncommonly fast.” “You are mistaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "I write rather slowly.” “How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year!\n",
      "\n",
      "Letters of business, too!\n",
      "\n",
      "How odious I should think them!” “It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.” “Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.” “I have already told her so once, by your desire.” “I am afraid you do not like your pen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me mend it for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mend pens remarkably well.” “Thank you--but I always mend my own.” “How can you contrive to write so even?” He was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's.” “Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?\n",
      "\n",
      "At present I have not room to do them justice.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "it is of no consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall see her in January.\n",
      "\n",
      "But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?” “They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.” “It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.” “That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her brother, “because he does not write with ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "He studies too much for words of four syllables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not you, Darcy?” “My style of writing is very different from yours.” “Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.\n",
      "\n",
      "He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.” “My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.” “Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.” “Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of humility.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.” “And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?” “The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?” “Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.” “I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and at another word, might stay a month.” “You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.” “I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.” “Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?” “Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself.” “You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.” “To yield readily--easily--to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.” “To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.” “You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?” “Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?” “By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.\n",
      "\n",
      "I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.” Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.” “Perhaps I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arguments are too much like disputes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.” “What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.” Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.\n",
      "\n",
      "The supposition did not pain her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She liked him too little to care for his approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her: “Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?” She smiled, but made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare.” “Indeed I do not dare.” Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.” “Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put them next to your great-uncle the judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?” “It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.” At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without telling us that you were coming out.” Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The path just admitted three.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said: “This walk is not wide enough for our party.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had better go into the avenue.” But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered: “No, no; stay where you are.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good-bye.” She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their powers of conversation were considerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was full of joy and attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way!\n",
      "\n",
      "I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!\n",
      "\n",
      "How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!\n",
      "\n",
      "When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.” No one made any reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said: “By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.” “If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.” “I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day.” “Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.” Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said: “Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.” Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What could he mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "She was dying to know what could be his meaning?”--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?\n",

      "“Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.” Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.\n",

      "“You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.” “Oh!\n",

      "No, no; I feel he may defy us there.\n",

      "Mr. Darcy may hug himself.” “Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth.\n",

      "“That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances.\n",

      "I dearly love a laugh.” “Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.” “Certainly,” replied Elizabeth--“there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without.” “Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.” “Such as vanity and pride.” “Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.\n",

      "You are safe from me.” “There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.” “And your defect is to hate everybody.” “And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstand them.” “Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.\n",

      "“Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?” Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for it.\n",

      "He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teasing than usual to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.” “Who do you mean, my dear?\n",
      "\n",
      "I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope my dinners are good enough for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not believe she often sees such at home.” “The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.” Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled.\n",

      "“A gentleman and a stranger!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure!\n",

      "how unlucky!\n",

      "There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this moment.” “It is not Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.” This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained: “About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray do not talk of that odious man.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.” Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.” “No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hate such false friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?” “Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.” “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dear Sir,-- “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, Mrs.\n",

      "--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends--but of this hereafter.\n",

      "If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, “WILLIAM COLLINS” “At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,” said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.” “There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him.” “Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.” Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot make him out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?” “No, my dear, I think not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am impatient to see him.” “In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem defective.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed.” To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.\n",

      "“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough.\n",

      "It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.\n",

      "Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all chance in this world.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.” “I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted--” He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "He begged pardon for having displeased her.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.” “That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does she live near you, sir?” “The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.” “I think you said she was a widow, sir?\n",
      "\n",
      "Has she any family?” “She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.” “Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than many girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what sort of young lady is she?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is she handsome?” “She is a most charming young lady indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.” “Has she been presented?\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not remember her name among the ladies at court.” “Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.” “You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?” “They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.” Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with: “Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.\n",
      "\n",
      "My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.” Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said: “I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I will no longer importune my young cousin.” Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.\n",
      "\n",
      "His plan did not vary on seeing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As to her younger daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not know of any prepossession; her eldest daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.” Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.\n",
      "\n",
      "In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.\n",
      "\n",
      "His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.\n",
      "\n",
      "The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "What could be the meaning of it?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.\n",
      "\n",
      "As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.\n",
      "\n",
      "In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was over at last, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life--” Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She dared not even mention that gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.” “Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one.\n",
      "\n",
      "A clear ten thousand per annum.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy.” Elizabeth could not but look surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?” “As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable.” “I have no right to give my opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being agreeable or otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not qualified to form one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible for me to be impartial.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here you are in your own family.” “Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody is disgusted with his pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.” “I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.” “I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.” “I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "no--it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\n",
      "\n",
      "His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.\n",
      "\n",
      "His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.” Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Society, I own, is necessary to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must have employment and society.\n",
      "\n",
      "A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The church ought to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.” “Indeed!” “Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot do justice to his kindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.” “Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could that be?\n",
      "\n",
      "How could his will be disregarded?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did you not seek legal redress?” “There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.\n",
      "\n",
      "A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can recall nothing worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.” “This is quite shocking!\n",
      "\n",
      "He deserves to be publicly disgraced.” “Some time or other he will be--but it shall not be by me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him.” Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?\n",
      "\n",
      "What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?” “A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me.” “I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had not thought so very ill of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this.” After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, “I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "His disposition must be dreadful.” “I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can hardly be just to him.” Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable”--but she contented herself with, “and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!” “We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself.” “How strange!” cried Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How abominable!\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for dishonesty I must call it.” “It is wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.” “Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?” “Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Family pride, and filial pride--for he is very proud of what his father was--have done this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.” “What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?” He shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish I could call her amiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she is too much like her brother--very, very proud.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she is nothing to me now.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.” After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying: “I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!\n",
      "\n",
      "How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?\n",
      "\n",
      "How can they suit each other?\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you know Mr. Bingley?” “Not at all.” “He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.\n",
      "\n",
      "He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.” “Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.\n",
      "\n",
      "He does not want abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.\n",
      "\n",
      "His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something for fortune and figure.” The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips.\n",
      "\n",
      "The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.” Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a living.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.” “You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.” “No, indeed, I did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.” “Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.” This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.” “I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.” Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "The possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.” “Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?\n",
      "\n",
      "Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.” “Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "no.” “I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, there was truth in his looks.” “It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.\n",
      "\n",
      "One does not know what to think.” “I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.” But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough--I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.” Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.” Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead!\n",
      "\n",
      "her liveliness had never been worse timed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no help for it, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "It now first struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.\n",
      "\n",
      "No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, “I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.” This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her: “I dare say you will find him very agreeable.” “Heaven forbid!\n",
      "\n",
      "That would be the greatest misfortune of all!\n",
      "\n",
      "To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not wish me such an evil.” When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      "He replied, and was again silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:--“It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.” He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "That reply will do for the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now we may be silent.” “Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?” “Sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "One must speak a little, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.” “Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?” “Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.” “This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.” “I must not decide on my own performance.” He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.\n",
      "\n",
      "She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.” The effect was immediate.\n",
      "\n",
      "A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, “Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends--whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain.” “He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.” Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such very superior dancing is not often seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is evident that you belong to the first circles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "What congratulations will then flow in!\n",
      "\n",
      "I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.” The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.” “I do not think we were speaking at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.” “What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Books--oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "no.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.” “I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may compare our different opinions.” “No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.” “The present always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he, with a look of doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created.” “I am,” said he, with a firm voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?” “I hope not.” “It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.” “May I ask to what these questions tend?” “Merely to the illustration of your character,” said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am trying to make it out.” “And what is your success?” She shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not get on at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.” “I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.” “But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.” “I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her: “So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!\n",
      "\n",
      "Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.” “His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself.” “I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.” “Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.” “No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.” “Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?” “No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.” “This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what does he say of the living?” “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only.” “I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly; “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.” She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.\n",
      "\n",
      "How wonderfully these sort of things occur!\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.\n",
      "\n",
      "My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.” “You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!” “Indeed I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe him to be Lady Catherine's nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.” Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus: “My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my reception.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was really a very handsome thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.” As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.\n",
      "\n",
      "His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.” “For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy?\n",
      "\n",
      "You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!” Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth now began to revive.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was in agonies.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That will do extremely well, child.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have delighted us long enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.” Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others of the party were now applied to.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rector of a parish has much to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.\n",
      "\n",
      "He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no arguing upon such a project.\n",
      "\n",
      "She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy said nothing at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord, how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins made his declaration in form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: “May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?” Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!--yes--certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out: “Dear madam, do not go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I beg you will not go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins must excuse me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going away myself.” “No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I desire you to stay where you are.” And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: “Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.” Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.\n",
      "\n",
      "You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission for this address.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.” The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued: “My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!)\n",
      "\n",
      "on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collins, you must marry.\n",
      "\n",
      "A clergyman like you must marry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.\n",
      "\n",
      "On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.” It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You forget that I have made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me do it without further loss of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.” “I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.” “Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am perfectly serious in my refusal.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.” “Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.” “Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.\n",
      "\n",
      "This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her: “When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.” “Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me exceedingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.” “You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.\n",
      "\n",
      "My situation in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.” “I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "My feelings in every respect forbid it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can I speak plainer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.” “You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.” To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\n",
      "\n",
      "This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will speak to her about it directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will make her know it.” “Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.\n",
      "\n",
      "If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.” “Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.\n",
      "\n",
      "In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.” She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her.” Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had finished her speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of what are you talking?” “Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.” “And what am I to do on the occasion?\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems an hopeless business.” “Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.” “Let her be called down.\n",
      "\n",
      "She shall hear my opinion.” Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have sent for you on an affair of importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?” “I have, sir.” “Very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now come to the point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your mother insists upon your accepting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?” “Yes, or I will never see her again.” “An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.” Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?\n",
      "\n",
      "You promised me to insist upon her marrying him.” “My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.” Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point.\n",
      "\n",
      "She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.\n",
      "\n",
      "She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.\n",
      "\n",
      "His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you think has happened this morning?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.” Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone, “for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.” Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall not be able to keep you--and so I warn you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have done with you from this very day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody can tell what I suffer!\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is always so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who do not complain are never pitied.” Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation.\n",
      "\n",
      "She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, “Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.” Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins!” “My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are all liable to error.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.”   The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.” She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said: “This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "You shall hear what she says.” She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next was in these words: “I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.\n",
      "\n",
      "I depend on you for that.” To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.” “Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will read it to you:” “When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of that I despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.” “It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this winter.” “It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he should.” “Why will you think so?\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be his own doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is his own master.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you do not know all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will have no reserves from you.” “Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?” “What do you think of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane as she finished it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it not clear enough?\n",
      "\n",
      "Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!)\n",
      "\n",
      "to put me on my guard?\n",
      "\n",
      "Can there be any other opinion on the subject?” “Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you hear it?” “Most willingly.” “You shall have it in a few words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.” Jane shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is not such a simpleton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.” “If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your representation of all this might make me quite easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I know the foundation is unjust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.” “That is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Believe her to be deceived, by all means.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.” “But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?” “You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.” “How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.” “I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.” “But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.\n",
      "\n",
      "A thousand things may arise in six months!” The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together.\n",
      "\n",
      "After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It keeps him in good humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.” Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.\n",
      "\n",
      "But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\n",
      "\n",
      "In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her reflections were in general satisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.\n",
      "\n",
      "But still he would be her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.\n",
      "\n",
      "This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.\n",
      "\n",
      "She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.” They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said: “But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?\n",
      "\n",
      "You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness.” “My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.” “You cannot be too much upon your guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.” “Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.” With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out: “Engaged to Mr. Collins!\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear Charlotte--impossible!” The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied: “Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?” But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must be surprised, very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not romantic, you know; I never was.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.” Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture!\n",
      "\n",
      "And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement to the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed: “Good Lord!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William, how can you tell such a story?\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?” Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could console and nothing could appease her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor did that day wear out her resentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.\n",
      "\n",
      "After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used.\n",
      "\n",
      "It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!” “My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us hope for better things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.” This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.” “What should not you mind?” “I should not mind anything at all.” “Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.” “I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail.\n",
      "\n",
      "How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should he have it more than anybody else?” “I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\n",
      "\n",
      "A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying: “Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!\n",
      "\n",
      "She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I will not repine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It cannot last long.\n",
      "\n",
      "He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.” Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank God!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not that pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "A little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.” With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.” “My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.” Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will.\n",
      "\n",
      "You need not.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is unaccountable!\n",
      "\n",
      "In every view it is unaccountable!” “My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.\n",
      "\n",
      "They will ruin your happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's steady, prudent character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.” “To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.\n",
      "\n",
      "You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness.” “I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But enough of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "You alluded to something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "You mentioned two instances.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women fancy admiration means more than it does.” “And men take care that they should.” “If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.” “I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,” said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.” “And do you impute it to either of those?” “Yes; to the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stop me whilst you can.” “You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?” “Yes, in conjunction with his friend.” “I cannot believe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should they try to influence him?\n",
      "\n",
      "They can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it.” “Your first position is false.\n",
      "\n",
      "They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.” “Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane; “but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.\n",
      "\n",
      "What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?\n",
      "\n",
      "If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not distress me by the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.” Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, Lizzy,” said he one day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find.\n",
      "\n",
      "I congratulate her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "When is your turn to come?\n",
      "\n",
      "You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now is your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let Wickham be your man.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.” “Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.” “True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it.” Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.\n",
      "\n",
      "They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had frequently been staying with her in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.\n",
      "\n",
      "When this was done she had a less active part to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "It became her turn to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Lizzy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, sister!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are all for what they can get.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.” Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sorry it went off.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these things happen so often!\n",
      "\n",
      "A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.” “An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it will not do for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do not suffer by accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.” “But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley's love?” “I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could there be finer symptoms?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is not general incivility the very essence of love?” “Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Jane!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.\n",
      "\n",
      "But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us?\n",
      "\n",
      "Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.” Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.\n",
      "\n",
      "We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.” “And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London!\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear aunt, how could you think of it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.” “So much the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope they will not meet at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "But does not Jane correspond with his sister?\n",
      "\n",
      "She will not be able to help calling.” “She will drop the acquaintance entirely.” But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation, narrowly observed them both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: “You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must not disappoint your father.” “My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.” “Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.” “Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.” “Elizabeth, you are not serious now.” “I beg your pardon, I will try again.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see the imprudence of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "that abominable Mr. Darcy!\n",
      "\n",
      "My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?\n",
      "\n",
      "All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, I will do my best.” “Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least, you should not remind your mother of inviting him.” “As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: “very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But do not imagine that he is always here so often.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.” Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she “wished they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said: “I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.” “That you certainly shall.” “And I have another favour to ask you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you come and see me?” “We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.” “I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.” Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and I hope you will consent to be of the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.” The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.\n",
      "\n",
      "She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.” She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I inquired after their brother, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I could see her.\n",
      "\n",
      "My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dare say I shall see them soon here.” Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.\n",
      "\n",
      "After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot understand it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me hear from you very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had better not mention it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.” This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.\n",

      "All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be no love in all this.\n",
      "\n",
      "My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.\n",

      "They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”   With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.\n",
      "\n",
      "March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "All was joy and kindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their first object was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.” “Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?\n",
      "\n",
      "Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?\n",
      "\n",
      "Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.” “If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.” “She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know no harm of her.” “But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune.” “No--why should he?\n",
      "\n",
      "If it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?” “But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event.” “A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.\n",
      "\n",
      "If she does not object to it, why should we?” “Her not objecting does not justify him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It only shows her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.” “Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish.” “No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sick of them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank Heaven!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.” “Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.” Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “but, perhaps, to the Lakes.” No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, my dear, dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight!\n",
      "\n",
      "what felicity!\n",
      "\n",
      "You give me fresh life and vigour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adieu to disappointment and spleen.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are young men to rocks and mountains?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "what hours of transport we shall spend!\n",
      "\n",
      "And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will know where we have gone--we will recollect what we have seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”   Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\n",
      "\n",
      "The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the Parsonage was discernible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.\n",
      "\n",
      "But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed: “Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.\n",
      "\n",
      "We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.” “Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,” added Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.” “Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.” The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lively imagination soon settled it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out-- “Oh, my dear Eliza!\n",
      "\n",
      "pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen!\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not tell you what it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make haste, and come down this moment.” Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter.” “La!\n",
      "\n",
      "my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady Catherine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only look at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is quite a little creature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?” “She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why does she not come in?” “Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.” “I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She looks sickly and cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, she will do for him very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "She will make him a very proper wife.” Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!” “I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William, “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.” Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth-- “Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion for anything more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.” While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James's.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's courage did not fail her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin and so small.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party did not supply much conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted.\n",
      "\n",
      "She inquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine then observed, “Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "For your sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?” “A little.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it some day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do your sisters play and sing?” “One of them does.” “Why did not you all learn?\n",
      "\n",
      "You ought all to have learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you draw?” “No, not at all.” “What, none of you?” “Not one.” “That is very strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I suppose you had no opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.” “My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.” “Has your governess left you?” “We never had any governess.” “No governess!\n",
      "\n",
      "How was that possible?\n",
      "\n",
      "Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!\n",
      "\n",
      "I never heard of such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.” Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then, who taught you?\n",
      "\n",
      "who attended to you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Without a governess, you must have been neglected.” “Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.” “Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me?\n",
      "\n",
      "She finds Miss Pope a treasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?” “Yes, ma'am, all.” “All!\n",
      "\n",
      "What, all five out at once?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very odd!\n",
      "\n",
      "And you only the second.\n",
      "\n",
      "The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!\n",
      "\n",
      "Your younger sisters must be very young?” “Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps she is full young to be much in company.\n",
      "\n",
      "But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to be kept back on such a motive!\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.” “Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray, what is your age?” “With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.” Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.” “I am not one-and-twenty.” When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their table was superlatively stupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great deal more passed at the other table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William did not say much.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.\n",
      "\n",
      "But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.\n",
      "\n",
      "She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding: “I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.” Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added: “My eldest sister has been in town these three months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you never happened to see her there?” She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out: “What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?\n",
      "\n",
      "What is it you are talking of?\n",
      "\n",
      "What are you telling Miss Bennet?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me hear what it is.” “We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of music!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then pray speak aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is of all subjects my delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?” Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal.” “I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "She practises very constantly.” “So much the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.\n",
      "\n",
      "I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house.” Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew a chair near her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said: “You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.” “I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.” Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.” “I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.” “You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?\n",
      "\n",
      "He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.” “I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.” “True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?\n",
      "\n",
      "My fingers wait your orders.” “Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.” “Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?” “I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is because he will not give himself the trouble.” “I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy, “of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.” “My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the trouble of practising.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution.” Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have employed your time much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting.\n",
      "\n",
      "We neither of us perform to strangers.” Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: “Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.” Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within.\n",
      "\n",
      "They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed: “How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\n",
      "\n",
      "It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?” “Perfectly so, I thank you.” She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added: “I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?” “I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.” “If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.” “I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.” Elizabeth made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.” “I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.” “Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.” “Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.\n",
      "\n",
      "She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.” “It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.” “An easy distance, do you call it?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is nearly fifty miles.” “And what is fifty miles of good road?\n",
      "\n",
      "Little more than half a day's journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I call it a very easy distance.” “I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match,” cried Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family.” “It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.” As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered: “I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that is not the case here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance.” Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "You cannot have been always at Longbourn.” Elizabeth looked surprised.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice: “Are you pleased with Kent?” A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tete-a-tete surprised them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way.” But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.\n",
      "\n",
      "All field sports were over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seldom appeared really animated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.\n",
      "\n",
      "He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it did, and even a third.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too.\n",
      "\n",
      "His words seemed to imply it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?\n",
      "\n",
      "She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said: “I did not know before that you ever walked this way.” “I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.\n",

      "\n",
      "When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?” “These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Younger sons cannot marry where they like.” “Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.” “Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.” “Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son?\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.” He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said: “I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.” “No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must divide with me.\n",

      "I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.” “Are you indeed?\n",
      "\n",

      "Does your charge give you much trouble?\n",
      "\n",
      "Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.” As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "She directly replied: “You need not be frightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I have heard you say that you know them.” “I know them a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he is a great friend of Darcy's.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.” “Care of him!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care.\n",
      "\n",
      "From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all conjecture.” “What is it you mean?” “It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing.” “You may depend upon my not mentioning it.” “And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.” “Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?” “I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.” “And what arts did he use to separate them?” “He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He only told me what I have now told you.” Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why was he to be the judge?” “You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?” “I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case.” “That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.” This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage.\n",
      "\n",
      "There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "There could not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent.\n",
      "\n",
      "They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\n",
      "\n",
      "She answered him with cold civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began: “In vain I have struggled.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will not do.\n",
      "\n",
      "My feelings will not be repressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.” Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.\n",
      "\n",
      "He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said: “In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation.” Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said: “And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!\n",
      "\n",
      "I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is of small importance.” “I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\n",
      "\n",
      "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil?\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have other provocations.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had not my feelings decided against you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?” As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued: “I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there.\n",
      "\n",
      "You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind.” She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\n",
      "\n",
      "He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself.” Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike is founded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this subject, what can you have to say?\n",
      "\n",
      "In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\n",
      "\n",
      "or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?” “You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,” said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?” “His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.” “And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have done all this!\n",
      "\n",
      "and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule.” “And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, “is your opinion of me!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the estimation in which you hold me!\n",
      "\n",
      "I thank you for explaining it so fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps,” added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.\n",
      "\n",
      "These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were natural and just.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?” Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said: “You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.” She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued: “You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it.” Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.\n",
      "\n",
      "She went on: “From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.” “You have said quite enough, madam.\n",
      "\n",
      "I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.” And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy!\n",
      "\n",
      "That he should have been in love with her for so many months!\n",
      "\n",
      "So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case--was almost incredible!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his pride, his abominable pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road.\n",
      "\n",
      "The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The envelope itself was likewise full.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:-- “Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had often seen him in love before.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your sister I also watched.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in error.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.\n",
      "\n",
      "That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.\n",
      "\n",
      "These causes must be stated, though briefly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pardon me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It pains me to offend you.\n",
      "\n",
      "But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The part which I acted is now to be explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I described, and enforced them earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.\n",
      "\n",
      "To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.\n",
      "\n",
      "I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "All connection between us seemed now dissolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "How he lived I know not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement.\n",
      "\n",
      "His revenge would have been complete indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will only add, God bless you.\n",
      "\n",
      "“FITZWILLIAM DARCY”   If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "His belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all pride and insolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!\n",
      "\n",
      "This cannot be!\n",
      "\n",
      "This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.\n",
      "\n",
      "She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success.\n",
      "\n",
      "On both sides it was only assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no such recollection befriended her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, alas!\n",
      "\n",
      "the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.\n",
      "\n",
      "How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!\n",
      "\n",
      "His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\n",
      "\n",
      "She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided myself on my discernment!\n",
      "\n",
      "I, who have valued myself on my abilities!\n",
      "\n",
      "who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!\n",
      "\n",
      "How humiliating is this discovery!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, how just a humiliation!\n",
      "\n",
      "Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!\n",
      "\n",
      "But vanity, not love, has been my folly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Till this moment I never knew myself.” From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation there had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.\n",
      "\n",
      "How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?\n",
      "\n",
      "He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.\n",
      "\n",
      "It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.\n",
      "\n",
      "After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she could think only of her letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What would she have said?\n",
      "\n",
      "how would she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me!\n",
      "\n",
      "They were excessively sorry to go!\n",
      "\n",
      "But so they always are.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "His attachment to Rosings certainly increases.” Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added: “But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure.” “I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must be in town next Saturday.” “Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I expected you to stay two months.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told Mrs. Collins so before you came.\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be no occasion for your going so soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.” “But my father cannot.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrote last week to hurry my return.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.” “You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan.” Lady Catherine seemed resigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collins, you must send a servant with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is highly improper.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must contrive to send somebody.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am excessively attentive to all those things.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.” “My uncle is to send a servant for us.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Your uncle!\n",
      "\n",
      "He keeps a man-servant, does he?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where shall you change horses?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Bromley, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.” Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were hopeless of remedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were ignorant, idle, and vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\n",
      "\n",
      "When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.” Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied: “It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see on what a footing we are.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see how continually we are engaged there.\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.” Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.\n",
      "\n",
      "I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We seem to have been designed for each other.” Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Charlotte!\n",
      "\n",
      "it was melancholy to leave her to such society!\n",
      "\n",
      "But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.\n",
      "\n",
      "After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here.” Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, “it seems but a day or two since we first came!\n",
      "\n",
      "and yet how many things have happened!” “A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!\n",
      "\n",
      "How much I shall have to tell!” Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!” Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals.\n",
      "\n",
      "To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.\n",
      "\n",
      "After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, “Is not this nice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is not this an agreeable surprise?” “And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing her purchases--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better.” And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.” “Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer!\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mamma would like to go too of all things!\n",
      "\n",
      "Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!” “Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “that would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good Heaven!\n",
      "\n",
      "Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!” “Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down at table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you think?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is excellent news--capital news--and about a certain person we all like!” Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia laughed, and said: “Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared!\n",
      "\n",
      "I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he is an ugly fellow!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad he is gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never saw such a long chin in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's for you!\n",
      "\n",
      "She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham is safe.” “And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.” “She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.” “But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure there is not on his.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?” Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you seen any pleasant men?\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you had any flirting?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is almost three-and-twenty!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty!\n",
      "\n",
      "My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think.\n",
      "\n",
      "She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord!\n",
      "\n",
      "how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear me!\n",
      "\n",
      "we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!)\n",
      "\n",
      "and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?\n",
      "\n",
      "We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!\n",
      "\n",
      "When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord!\n",
      "\n",
      "how I laughed!\n",
      "\n",
      "and so did Mrs. Forster.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I should have died.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.” With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their reception at home was most kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth: “I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.” Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\n",
      "\n",
      "As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then when we came away it was such fun!\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought we never should have got into the coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was ready to die of laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then we were so merry all the way home!\n",
      "\n",
      "we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!” To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures!\n",
      "\n",
      "They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I confess they would have no charms for me--I should infinitely prefer a book.” But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another reason too for her opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comfort to her of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment!” “Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?” “Blame you!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, no.” “But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?” “No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.” “But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day.” She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a stroke was this for poor Jane!\n",
      "\n",
      "who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both of them good for anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's; but you shall do as you choose.” It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wickham so very bad!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is almost past belief.\n",
      "\n",
      "And poor Mr. Darcy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a disappointment!\n",
      "\n",
      "and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!\n",
      "\n",
      "and having to relate such a thing of his sister!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is really too distressing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure you must feel it so.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.” “Poor Wickham!\n",
      "\n",
      "there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!\n",
      "\n",
      "such an openness and gentleness in his manner!” “There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.\n",
      "\n",
      "One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.” “I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do.” “And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.” “Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.” “Indeed, I could not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "how I wanted you!” “How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved.” “Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one point on which I want your advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham's character.” Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is your opinion?” “That it ought not to be attempted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?\n",
      "\n",
      "The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not equal to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present I will say nothing about it.” “You are quite right.\n",
      "\n",
      "To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must not make him desperate.” The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then,” said she, “if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!” She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was not happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's?\n",
      "\n",
      "For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told my sister Phillips so the other day.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, he is a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.” “I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.” “Oh well!\n",
      "\n",
      "it is just as he chooses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody wants him to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.” But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, well, I only hope it will last.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what sort of table do they keep?\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.\n",
      "\n",
      "If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare say.” “No, nothing at all.” “A great deal of good management, depend upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, yes, they will take care not to outrun their income.\n",
      "\n",
      "They will never be distressed for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, much good may it do them!\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.” “It was a subject which they could not mention before me.” “No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”   The first week of their return was soon gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second began.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dejection was almost universal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good Heaven!\n",
      "\n",
      "what is to become of us?\n",
      "\n",
      "What are we to do?” would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?” Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller's regiment went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I should have broken my heart.” “I am sure I shall break mine,” said Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton!\n",
      "\n",
      "But papa is so disagreeable.” “A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.” “And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,” added Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.\n",
      "\n",
      "This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.\n",
      "\n",
      "A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia,” said she, “Though I am not her particular friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.” In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.\n",
      "\n",
      "She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard her attentively, and then said: “Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.” “If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.” “Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor little Lizzy!\n",
      "\n",
      "But do not be cast down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.” “Indeed you are mistaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no such injuries to resent.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excuse me, for I must speak plainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this danger Kitty also is comprehended.\n",
      "\n",
      "She will follow wherever Lydia leads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?” Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply: “Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let her go, then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The officers will find women better worth their notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life.” With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?\n",
      "\n",
      "They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her answer was warmly in his favour.\n",
      "\n",
      "With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added: “How long did you say he was at Rosings?” “Nearly three weeks.” “And you saw him frequently?” “Yes, almost every day.” “His manners are very different from his cousin's.” “Yes, very different.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.” “Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And pray, may I ask?--” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in address that he improves?\n",
      "\n",
      "Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.” “Oh, no!” said Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was.” While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added: “When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.” Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents: “You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe.\n",
      "\n",
      "His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.” Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.\n",
      "\n",
      "To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised.\n",
      "\n",
      "A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.” When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything wore a happier aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.” The period of expectation was now doubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "are sufficiently known.\n",
      "\n",
      "A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.” Elizabeth was distressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If it were merely a fine house richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have some of the finest woods in the country.” Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.\n",
      "\n",
      "The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be dreadful!\n",
      "\n",
      "She blushed at the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place?\n",
      "\n",
      "what was the name of its proprietor?\n",
      "\n",
      "and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer?\n",
      "\n",
      "A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.\n",
      "\n",
      "They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was delighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\n",
      "\n",
      "They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.\n",
      "\n",
      "They followed her into the dining-parlour.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress!\n",
      "\n",
      "With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no,”--recollecting herself--“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.” This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like regret.\n",
      "\n",
      "She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent, but had not the courage for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\n",
      "\n",
      "Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is now gone into the army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.” Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, “is my master--and very like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago.” “I have heard much of your master's fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.” Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?” Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.” “And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?” “Yes, very handsome.” “I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.\n",
      "\n",
      "This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was very fond of them.” This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.” Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?” “Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.” “Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.” “If your master would marry, you might see more of him.” “Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know who is good enough for him.” Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.” “I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,” replied the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.” This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying: “There are very few people of whom so much can be said.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are lucky in having such a master.” “Yes, sir, I know I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world.” Elizabeth almost stared at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor.” Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point.\n",
      "\n",
      "She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.” “In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.” “Perhaps we might be deceived.” “That is not very likely; our authority was too good.” On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And this is always the way with him,” she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing he would not do for her.” The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?\n",
      "\n",
      "As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him!\n",
      "\n",
      "Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush.\n",
      "\n",
      "He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was overpowered by shame and vexation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world!\n",
      "\n",
      "How strange it must appear to him!\n",
      "\n",
      "In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!\n",
      "\n",
      "It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "why did she come?\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?\n",
      "\n",
      "Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "And his behaviour, so strikingly altered--what could it mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!\n",
      "\n",
      "Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand!\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was.\n",
      "\n",
      "She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.\n",
      "\n",
      "It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her colour changed, and she said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they are?\n",
      "\n",
      "He takes them now for people of fashion.” The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "That he was surprised by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.\n",
      "\n",
      "She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered?\n",
      "\n",
      "From what can it proceed?\n",
      "\n",
      "It cannot be for me--it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened.\n",
      "\n",
      "My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible that he should still love me.” After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short silence, the lady first spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.” Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?” The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it.” “I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.” “To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?” Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied her uncle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.” Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has not an ill-natured look.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\n",
      "\n",
      "I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.” Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.\n",
      "\n",
      "While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.\n",
      "\n",
      "With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again.\n",
      "\n",
      "He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had long wished to see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.\n",
      "\n",
      "He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight months.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.” Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.\n",
      "\n",
      "They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out.\n",
      "\n",
      "She certainly did not hate him.\n",
      "\n",
      "No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.\n",
      "\n",
      "The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.\n",
      "\n",
      "He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were, therefore, to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\n",
      "\n",
      "By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her own thoughts were employing her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.\n",
      "\n",
      "After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was now employment for the whole party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility: “Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?\n",
      "\n",
      "They must be a great loss to your family.” In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement.\n",
      "\n",
      "To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Georgiana would not join her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is grown so brown and coarse!\n",
      "\n",
      "Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.” However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her nose wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.” Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued: “I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, 'She a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.'\n",
      "\n",
      "But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.” “Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.” He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.\n",
      "\n",
      "The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was to this effect: “Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine our surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very, very sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "So imprudent a match on both sides!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our poor mother is sadly grieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father bears it better.\n",
      "\n",
      "How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The express was sent off directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written.” Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know not what to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\n",
      "\n",
      "Impossible!\n",
      "\n",
      "I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted.\n",
      "\n",
      "My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adieu!\n",
      "\n",
      "I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.\n",
      "\n",
      "What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such an exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.” “Good God!\n",
      "\n",
      "what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.” Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, “Let me call your maid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief?\n",
      "\n",
      "A glass of wine; shall I get you one?\n",
      "\n",
      "You are very ill.” “No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is nothing the matter with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.” She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length she spoke again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.\n",
      "\n",
      "It cannot be concealed from anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "My younger sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are gone off together from Brighton.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know him too well to doubt the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.” Darcy was fixed in astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When I consider,” she added in a yet more agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it!\n",
      "\n",
      "I, who knew what he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family!\n",
      "\n",
      "Had his character been known, this could not have happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is all--all too late now.” “I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved--shocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is it certain--absolutely certain?” “Oh, yes!\n",
      "\n",
      "They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland.” “And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?” “My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "But nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is such a man to be worked on?\n",
      "\n",
      "How are they even to be discovered?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not the smallest hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is every way horrible!” Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When my eyes were opened to his real character--Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "had I known what I ought, what I dared to do!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wretched, wretched mistake!” Darcy made no answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air gloomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia--the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.” “Oh, yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.” He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\n",
      "\n",
      "If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now it was all too natural.\n",
      "\n",
      "For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "how acutely did she now feel it!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were to be off as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what is to be done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?” “Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is all settled.” “What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, that I knew how it was!” But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?\n",
      "\n",
      "Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?\n",
      "\n",
      "His temptation is not adequate to the risk!” “Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle's opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?” “Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, indeed, it should be so!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I dare not hope it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?” “In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption!\n",
      "\n",
      "And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road.” “Well, then--supposing them to be in London.\n",
      "\n",
      "They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.” “But why all this secrecy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why any fear of detection?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why must their marriage be private?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, no, no--this is not likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.\n",
      "\n",
      "He cannot afford it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?\n",
      "\n",
      "As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.” “But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?” “It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, “that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, really, I know not what to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I am not doing her justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it?\n",
      "\n",
      "susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.” “But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.” “Of whom does Jane ever think ill?\n",
      "\n",
      "And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.\n",
      "\n",
      "We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.” “And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet he knew to the contrary himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her.” “But does Lydia know nothing of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?” “Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.\n",
      "\n",
      "As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown?\n",
      "\n",
      "And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "That such a consequence as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.” “When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?” “Not the slightest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”              * * * * * It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not yet,” replied Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well.” “Is my father in town?” “Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.” “And have you heard from him often?” “We have heard only twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention.” “And my mother--how is she?\n",
      "\n",
      "How are you all?” “My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.\n",
      "\n",
      "She does not yet leave her dressing-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.” “But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You look pale.\n",
      "\n",
      "How much you must have gone through!” Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor dear child!\n",
      "\n",
      "And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do.” They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I could most wish for.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.\n",
      "\n",
      "And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, brother, how kind you are!\n",
      "\n",
      "I know you will contrive it all.” But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before.\n",
      "\n",
      "One came from her books, and the other from her toilette.\n",
      "\n",
      "The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table: “This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.” Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, “Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.” Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.\n",
      "\n",
      "After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give me further particulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "What did Colonel Forster say?\n",
      "\n",
      "Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place?\n",
      "\n",
      "They must have seen them together for ever.” “Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so grieved for him!\n",
      "\n",
      "His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.” “And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?\n",
      "\n",
      "Did he know of their intending to go off?\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?” “Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.” “And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?” “How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a step.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks.” “But not before they went to Brighton?” “No, I believe not.” “And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Does he know his real character?” “I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.\n",
      "\n",
      "He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\n",
      "\n",
      "And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.” “Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!” “Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "We acted with the best intentions.” “Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?” “He brought it with him for us to see.” Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were the contents: “MY DEAR HARRIET, “You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.\n",
      "\n",
      "You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.'\n",
      "\n",
      "What a good joke it will be!\n",
      "\n",
      "I can hardly write for laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good-bye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give my love to Colonel Forster.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you will drink to our good journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your affectionate friend, “LYDIA BENNET.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had finished it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!\n",
      "\n",
      "But at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My poor father!\n",
      "\n",
      "how he must have felt it!” “I never saw anyone so shocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?” “I do not know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope there was.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done!\n",
      "\n",
      "But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.” “Your attendance upon her has been too much for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "You do not look well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh that I had been with you!\n",
      "\n",
      "you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.” “Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on.\n",
      "\n",
      "My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was of great use and comfort to us all.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if they should be of use to us.” “She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.” She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.”   The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.\n",
      "\n",
      "All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was also a postscript to this effect: “I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present we have nothing to guide us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other person.” Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's impatience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was as follows: “MY DEAR SIR, “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.\n",
      "\n",
      "No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent's mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?\n",
      "\n",
      "And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am, dear sir, etc., etc.” Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.\n",
      "\n",
      "His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.\n",
      "\n",
      "He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane heard them with horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A gamester!” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is wholly unexpected.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had not an idea of it.” Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?” As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.\n",

      "The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.\n",
      "\n",
      "The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say nothing of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who should suffer but myself?\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.” “You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may well warn me against such an evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human nature is so prone to fall into it!\n",
      "\n",
      "No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will pass away soon enough.” “Do you suppose them to be in London?” “Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?” “And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there will probably be of some duration.” Then after a short silence he continued: “Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.” They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune!\n",
      "\n",
      "Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.” “I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.” “You go to Brighton.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds!\n",
      "\n",
      "No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.” Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.”   Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.” “What do you mean, Hill?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have heard nothing from town.” “Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner?\n",
      "\n",
      "He has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.” Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said: “If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse.” Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out: “Oh, papa, what news--what news?\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you heard from my uncle?” “Yes I have had a letter from him by express.” “Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?” “What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But perhaps you would like to read it.” Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane now came up.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is about.” “Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "“MY DEAR BROTHER, “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were.\n",
      "\n",
      "The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have seen them both--” “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!” Elizabeth read on: “I have seen them both.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve.\n",
      "\n",
      "She comes to us to-day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yours, etc., “EDW.\n",
      "\n",
      "GARDINER.” “Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can it be possible that he will marry her?” “Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear father, I congratulate you.” “And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; but it must be done soon.” Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider how important every moment is in such a case.” “Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble yourself.” “I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.” And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And may I ask--” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.” “Complied with!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am only ashamed of his asking so little.” “And they must marry!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet he is such a man!” “Yes, yes, they must marry.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing else to be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.” “Money!\n",
      "\n",
      "My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?” “I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.” “That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me before.\n",
      "\n",
      "His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "it must be my uncle's doings!\n",
      "\n",
      "Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "A small sum could not do all this.” “No,” said her father; “Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.” “Ten thousand pounds!\n",
      "\n",
      "Heaven forbid!\n",
      "\n",
      "How is half such a sum to be repaid?” Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How strange this is!\n",
      "\n",
      "And for this we are to be thankful.\n",
      "\n",
      "That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, Lydia!” “I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has children of his own, and may have more.\n",
      "\n",
      "How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?” “If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,” said Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time she is actually with them!\n",
      "\n",
      "If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy!\n",
      "\n",
      "What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!” “We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.” “Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is useless to talk of it.” It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied: “Just as you please.” “May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?” “Take whatever you like, and get away.” Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To know that her daughter would be married was enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is delightful indeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "She will be married!\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall see her again!\n",
      "\n",
      "She will be married at sixteen!\n",
      "\n",
      "My good, kind brother!\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew how it would be.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew he would manage everything!\n",
      "\n",
      "How I long to see her!\n",
      "\n",
      "and to see dear Wickham too!\n",
      "\n",
      "But the clothes, the wedding clothes!\n",
      "\n",
      "I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stay, stay, I will go myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will put on my things in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear, dear Lydia!\n",
      "\n",
      "How merry we shall be together when we meet!” Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great measure to his kindness.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.” “Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?\n",
      "\n",
      "If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so happy!\n",
      "\n",
      "In a short time I shall have a daughter married.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wickham!\n",
      "\n",
      "How well it sounds!\n",
      "\n",
      "And she was only sixteen last June.\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.” She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day's delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other schemes, too, came into her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty, run down and order the carriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Here comes Hill!\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.” Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.\n",
      "\n",
      "She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He now wished it more than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son.\n",
      "\n",
      "The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.\n",
      "\n",
      "This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement.\n",
      "\n",
      "He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within that sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was considered certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.\n",
      "\n",
      "No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it--or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off!\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.” Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: “Mrs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.” A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.\n",
      "\n",
      "From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.\n",
      "\n",
      "She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully received!\n",
      "\n",
      "He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.\n",
      "\n",
      "She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.\n",
      "\n",
      "His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.\n",
      "\n",
      "An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "* * * * * Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his marriage was fixed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think you will agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information?\n",
      "\n",
      "He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--Yours, etc., “E.\n",
      "\n",
      "GARDINER.” Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking to send her away!\n",
      "\n",
      "And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s regiment.” His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.\n",
      "\n",
      "And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\n",
      "\n",
      "They came.\n",
      "\n",
      "The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.\n",
      "\n",
      "His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.\n",
      "\n",
      "She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no want of discourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.\n",
      "\n",
      "They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good gracious!\n",
      "\n",
      "when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again!\n",
      "\n",
      "though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.” Her father lifted up his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was distressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.” Elizabeth could bear it no longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, “Ah!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman.” It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ease and good spirits increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham” by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, “and what do you think of my husband?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is not he a charming man?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure my sisters must all envy me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I only hope they may have half my good luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "They must all go to Brighton.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is the place to get husbands.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.” “Very true; and if I had my will, we should.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Must it be so?” “Oh, lord!\n",
      "\n",
      "yes;--there is nothing in that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall like it of all things.\n",
      "\n",
      "You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.” “I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.” “I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.” Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: “Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?” “No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said on the subject.” “La!\n",
      "\n",
      "You are so strange!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I must tell you how it went off.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.” “Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not one party, or scheme, or anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.” “Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "But gracious me!\n",
      "\n",
      "I quite forgot!\n",
      "\n",
      "I ought not to have said a word about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I promised them so faithfully!\n",
      "\n",
      "What will Wickham say?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was to be such a secret!” “If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may depend upon my seeking no further.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will ask you no questions.” “Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.” On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy had been at her sister's wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.” “Not that I shall, though,” she added to herself, as she finished the letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.” Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "“MY DEAR NIECE, “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "His character was to speak for itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what.\n",
      "\n",
      "She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were in ---- street.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design.\n",
      "\n",
      "He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On Saturday he came again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.\n",
      "\n",
      "But our visitor was very obstinate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people.\n",
      "\n",
      "His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody's reserve, can be answerable for the event.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe I have now told you every thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.\n",
      "\n",
      "His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name.\n",
      "\n",
      "But slyness seems the fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park.\n",
      "\n",
      "A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I must write no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The children have been wanting me this half hour.\n",

      "GARDINER.” The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!\n",
      "\n",
      "He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brother-in-law of Wickham!\n",
      "\n",
      "Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had, to be sure, done much.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was ashamed to think how much.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.\n",
      "\n",
      "They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he, as he joined her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.” “I should be sorry indeed, if it were.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were always good friends; and now we are better.” “True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are the others coming out?” “I do not know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.” She replied in the affirmative.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But of course she did not mention my name to you.” “Yes, she did.” “And what did she say?” “That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well.\n",
      "\n",
      "At such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.” “Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said: “I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.\n",
      "\n",
      "We passed each other several times.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder what he can be doing there.” “Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.” “Undoubtedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see him while you were at Lambton?\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.” “Yes; he introduced us to his sister.” “And do you like her?” “Very much.” “I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I last saw her, she was not very promising.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very glad you liked her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope she will turn out well.” “I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.” “Did you go by the village of Kympton?” “I do not recollect that we did.” “I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.\n",
      "\n",
      "A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House!\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have suited me in every respect.” “How should you have liked making sermons?” “Exceedingly well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "One ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me!\n",
      "\n",
      "The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness!\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was not to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?” “I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.” “You have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the first, you may remember.” “I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly.” “You did!\n",
      "\n",
      "and it was not wholly without foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.” They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile: “Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not let us quarrel about the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind.” She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?” “Oh, lord!\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not these two or three years, perhaps.” “Write to me very often, my dear.” “As often as I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you know married women have never much time for writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sisters may write to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "They will have nothing else to do.” Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, “as ever I saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am prodigiously proud of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.” The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "One seems so forlorn without them.” “This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.” “It is no such thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.\n",
      "\n",
      "If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.” But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news).\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, so much the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that I care about it, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And who knows what may happen?\n",
      "\n",
      "But that is nothing to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, is it quite certain he is coming?” “You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.\n",
      "\n",
      "He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.” Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said: “I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But don't imagine it was from any silly cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people's remarks.” Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation!\n",
      "\n",
      "I will leave him to himself.” In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you will wait on him of course.” “No, no.\n",
      "\n",
      "You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.” His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he wants our society, let him seek it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knows where we live.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.” “Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.” Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before they did.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the day of his arrival drew near,-- “I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.\n",
      "\n",
      "My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!” “I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it is wholly out of my power.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much.” Mr. Bingley arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could.\n",
      "\n",
      "She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?” “Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.” “La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. what's-his-name.\n",
      "\n",
      "That tall, proud man.” “Good gracious!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy!--and so it does, I vow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.” Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she would not be secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early enough for expectation.” She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.\n",
      "\n",
      "There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yet why did he come?” She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "He readily agreed to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I began to be afraid you would never come back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Lucas is married and settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "And one of my own daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq.\n",
      "\n",
      "to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you see it?” Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,” continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long.\n",
      "\n",
      "His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank Heaven!\n",
      "\n",
      "he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.” Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few weeks, he believed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother, “I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.” Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!\n",
      "\n",
      "Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be in company with either of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this!\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me never see either one or the other again!” Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement.” Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business.\n",
      "\n",
      "They then went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she, “did he come at all?” She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?\n",
      "\n",
      "If he fears me, why come hither?\n",
      "\n",
      "If he no longer cares for me, why silent?\n",
      "\n",
      "Teasing, teasing, man!\n",
      "\n",
      "I will think no more about him.” Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.” “Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Jane, take care.” “My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?” “I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.”              * * * * * They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.\n",
      "\n",
      "He placed himself by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was on one side of her mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If he does not come to me, then,” said she, “I shall give him up for ever.” The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas!\n",
      "\n",
      "the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper: “The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "We want none of them; do we?” Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!\n",
      "\n",
      "“A man who has once been refused!\n",
      "\n",
      "How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!” She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying: “Is your sister at Pemberley still?” “Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.” “And quite alone?\n",
      "\n",
      "Have all her friends left her?” “Mrs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Annesley is with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks.” She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\n",

      "I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.” Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.” “You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.” “How hard it is in some cases to be believed!” “And how impossible in others!” “But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?” “That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.\n",

      "Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their situation was awkward enough; but hers she thought was still worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "“'Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not deserve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "why is not everybody as happy?” Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is gone to my father already.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family!\n",
      "\n",
      "how shall I bear so much happiness!” She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection!\n",
      "\n",
      "of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance!\n",
      "\n",
      "the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!” In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With my mother up stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "She will be down in a moment, I dare say.” He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said: “Jane, I congratulate you.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will be a very happy woman.” Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your tempers are by no means unlike.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.” “I hope not so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me.” “Exceed their income!\n",
      "\n",
      "My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you talking of?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew how it would be.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always said it must be so, at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing!\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!” Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was beyond competition her favourite child.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment, she cared for no other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!\n",
      "\n",
      "I had not believed it possible.” “I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But how did he account for it?” “It must have been his sister's doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.” “That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever heard you utter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good girl!\n",
      "\n",
      "It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.” “Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!” “He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty.” This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all!\n",
      "\n",
      "If I could but see you as happy!\n",
      "\n",
      "If there were but such another man for you!” “If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.” The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.\n",
      "\n",
      "They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\n",
      "\n",
      "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth, “I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "That lady, I suppose, is your mother.” Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And that I suppose is one of your sisters.” “Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is my youngest girl but one.\n",
      "\n",
      "My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.” “You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.” “This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west.” Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added: “May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.” “Yes, very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw them the night before last.” Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth, “Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.” “Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the different walks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.” Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:-- “You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.” Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.” “Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.\n",
      "\n",
      "But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so.\n",
      "\n",
      "My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.” “If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "What could your ladyship propose by it?” “At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.” “Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.” “If!\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?” “I never heard that it was.” “And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?” “I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.” “This is not to be borne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?” “Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.” “It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may have drawn him in.” “If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.” “Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not been accustomed to such language as this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.” “But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.” “Let me be rightly understood.\n",
      "\n",
      "This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, never.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now what have you to say?” “Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.” Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied: “The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of hers.\n",
      "\n",
      "While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family!\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?\n",
      "\n",
      "To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh?\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?” “Yes, and I had heard it before.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is that to me?\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its completion depended on others.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?\n",
      "\n",
      "And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?” “Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.” “These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.” “Obstinate, headstrong girl!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am ashamed of you!\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is nothing due to me on that score?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us sit down.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.” “That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me.” “I will not be interrupted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hear me in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their fortune on both sides is splendid.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?\n",
      "\n",
      "The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this to be endured!\n",
      "\n",
      "But it must not, shall not be.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.” “In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal.” “True.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are a gentleman's daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "But who was your mother?\n",
      "\n",
      "Who are your uncles and aunts?\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.” “Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.” “Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?” Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation: “I am not.” Lady Catherine seemed pleased.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?” “I will make no promise of the kind.” “Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.\n",
      "\n",
      "I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.” “And I certainly never shall give it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable?\n",
      "\n",
      "Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\n",
      "\n",
      "Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\n",
      "\n",
      "How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.” “Not so hasty, if you please.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have by no means done.\n",
      "\n",
      "To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother?\n",
      "\n",
      "Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking?\n",
      "\n",
      "Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?” “You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have insulted me in every possible method.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must beg to return to the house.” And she rose as she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ladyship was highly incensed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfeeling, selfish girl!\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?” “Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know my sentiments.” “You are then resolved to have him?” “I have said no such thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.” “It is well.\n",
      "\n",
      "You refuse, then, to oblige me.\n",
      "\n",
      "You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.” “Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.” “And this is your real opinion!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is your final resolve!\n",
      "\n",
      "Very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall now know how to act.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came to try you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.” In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.\n",
      "\n",
      "I send no compliments to your mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "You deserve no such attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am most seriously displeased.” Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.” “She is a very fine-looking woman!\n",
      "\n",
      "and her calling here was prodigiously civil!\n",
      "\n",
      "for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?” Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a rational scheme, to be sure!\n",
      "\n",
      "but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.\n",
      "\n",
      "And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.\n",
      "\n",
      "With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case he would return no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.”              * * * * * The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my room.” She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.\n",
      "\n",
      "It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.\n",
      "\n",
      "She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then said, “I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.” The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued: “You look conscious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This letter is from Mr. Collins.” “From Mr. Collins!\n",
      "\n",
      "and what can he have to say?” “Something very much to the purpose of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.'\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\n",
      "\n",
      "'This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.'\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?\n",
      "\n",
      "But now it comes out: “'My motive for cautioning you is as follows.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.'\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy, you see, is the man!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is admirable!” Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you not diverted?” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray read on.” “'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "That is his notion of Christian forgiveness!\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.\n",
      "\n",
      "For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?” “Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is so strange!” “Yes--that is what makes it amusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd!\n",
      "\n",
      "Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.\n",
      "\n",
      "And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?\n",
      "\n",
      "Did she call to refuse her consent?” To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was agreed to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said: “Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.” “I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.” “You must not blame my aunt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.” “If you will thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.\n",
      "\n",
      "But your family owe me nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you.” Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a short pause, her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.” Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances.\n",
      "\n",
      "The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "They walked on, without knowing in what direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.” Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.” “What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?\n",
      "\n",
      "For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was unpardonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot think of it without abhorrence.” “We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,” said Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.” “I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were your words.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.” “I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.” “I can easily believe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.\n",
      "\n",
      "The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.” “Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "do not repeat what I then said.\n",
      "\n",
      "These recollections will not do at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.” Darcy mentioned his letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did it,” said he, “did it soon make you think better of me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?” She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you have destroyed the letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.” “The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.” “When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.” “The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.\n",
      "\n",
      "The adieu is charity itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But think no more of the letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must learn some of my philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.” “I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with me, it is not so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!\n",
      "\n",
      "What do I not owe you!\n",
      "\n",
      "You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.\n",
      "\n",
      "By you, I was properly humbled.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came to you without a doubt of my reception.\n",
      "\n",
      "You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.” “Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?” “Indeed I had.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will you think of my vanity?\n",
      "\n",
      "I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.” “My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "How you must have hated me after that evening?” “Hate you!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.” “I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley.\n",
      "\n",
      "You blamed me for coming?” “No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.” “Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you.\n",
      "\n",
      "My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due.” “My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.\n",
      "\n",
      "How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.” He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\n",
      "\n",
      "She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\n",
      "\n",
      "After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.” “That is to say, you had given your permission.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guessed as much.” And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.\n",
      "\n",
      "His surprise was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had never had the slightest suspicion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.” Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?” “From the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.” “And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.” “It did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.\n",
      "\n",
      "His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has heartily forgiven me now.” Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the hall they parted.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\n",
      "\n",
      "At night she opened her heart to Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are joking, Lizzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy!\n",
      "\n",
      "No, no, you shall not deceive me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know it to be impossible.” “This is a wretched beginning indeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I speak nothing but the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "He still loves me, and we are engaged.” Jane looked at her doubtingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Lizzy!\n",
      "\n",
      "it cannot be.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know how much you dislike him.” “You know nothing of the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is all to be forgot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself.” Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good Heaven!\n",
      "\n",
      "can it be really so!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet now I must believe you,” cried Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain?\n",
      "\n",
      "forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?” “There can be no doubt of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "But are you pleased, Jane?\n",
      "\n",
      "Shall you like to have such a brother?” “Very, very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you really love him quite well enough?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, Lizzy!\n",
      "\n",
      "do anything rather than marry without affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?” “Oh, yes!\n",
      "\n",
      "You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all.” “What do you mean?” “Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am afraid you will be angry.” “My dearest sister, now be serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to talk very seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you tell me how long you have loved him?” “It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.” Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always had a value for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!\n",
      "\n",
      "I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.” Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "* * * * * “Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley!\n",
      "\n",
      "What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?\n",
      "\n",
      "I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.\n",
      "\n",
      "What shall we do with him?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way.” Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?” “I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.” “It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Won't it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying: “I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.” During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.\n",
      "\n",
      "She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.\n",
      "\n",
      "* * * * * In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.\n",
      "\n",
      "She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your father, he wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?\n",
      "\n",
      "Have not you always hated him?” How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!\n",
      "\n",
      "It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "But will they make you happy?” “Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my indifference?” “None at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.” “I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I love him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed he has no improper pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is perfectly amiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms.” “Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me advise you to think better of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know your disposition, Lizzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "You could scarcely escape discredit and misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know not what you are about.” Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months' suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this be the case, he deserves you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.” To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard her with astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is an evening of wonders, indeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission!\n",
      "\n",
      "So much the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will save me a world of trouble and economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.” He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.” Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good gracious!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord bless me!\n",
      "\n",
      "only think!\n",
      "\n",
      "dear me!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy!\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would have thought it!\n",
      "\n",
      "And is it really true?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "\n",
      "my sweetest Lizzy!\n",
      "\n",
      "how rich and how great you will be!\n",
      "\n",
      "What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so pleased--so happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a charming man!--so handsome!\n",
      "\n",
      "so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy!\n",
      "\n",
      "pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope he will overlook it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear, dear Lizzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A house in town!\n",
      "\n",
      "Every thing that is charming!\n",
      "\n",
      "Three daughters married!\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten thousand a year!\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, Lord!\n",
      "\n",
      "What will become of me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall go distracted.” This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.\n",
      "\n",
      "But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else!\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten thousand a year, and very likely more!\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tis as good as a Lord!\n",
      "\n",
      "And a special licence.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must and shall be married by a special licence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.” This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's.”   Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How could you begin?” said she.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?” “I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is too long ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.” “My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?” “For the liveliness of your mind, I did.” “You may as well call it impertinence at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very little less.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.\n",
      "\n",
      "There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love.” “Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?” “Dearest Jane!\n",
      "\n",
      "who could have done less for her?\n",
      "\n",
      "But make a virtue of it by all means.\n",
      "\n",
      "My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?” “Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.” “But I was embarrassed.” “And so was I.” “You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.” “A man who had felt less, might.” “How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you!\n",
      "\n",
      "My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise?\n",
      "\n",
      "for I ought not to have mentioned the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "This will never do.” “You need not distress yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moral will be perfectly fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.” “Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.\n",
      "\n",
      "But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?\n",
      "\n",
      "or had you intended any more serious consequence?” “My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.” “Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her?” “I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly.” “And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.” From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: “I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.\n",
      "\n",
      "You supposed more than really existed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "How could I be so silly as to wish it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Your idea of the ponies is delightful.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will go round the Park every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am the happiest creature in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yours, etc.” Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.\n",
      "\n",
      "“DEAR SIR, “I must trouble you once more for congratulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has more to give.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yours sincerely, etc.” Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.\n",
      "\n",
      "At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bore it, however, with admirable calmness.\n",
      "\n",
      "He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\n",
      "\n",
      "With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.\n",
      "\n",
      "He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.\n",
      "\n",
      "So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.\n",
      "\n",
      "The letter was to this effect: “MY DEAR LIZZY, “I wish you joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yours, etc.” As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.\n",
      "\n",
      "His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were able to love each other even as well as they intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.\n",
      "\n",
      "By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.\n",

      "\n",
      "lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball ; and a report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly .\n",
      "\n",
      "the girls grieved over such a number of ladies , but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from london : his five sisters and a cousin .\n",

      "\n",
      "the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr. bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity ; for he was discovered to be proud ; to be above his company , and above being pleased ; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room ; he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield .\n",

      "\n",
      "his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own ; but , though he was now only established as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table : nor was mrs. hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her .\n",

      "\n",
      "darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure .\n",

      "\n",
      "for , though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to everybody .\n",

      "mr. collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society ; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father ; and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance .\n",
      "\n",
      "the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner ; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity .\n",

      "the next morning , however , made an alteration ; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with mrs. bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" as to her younger daughters , she could not take upon her to say : she could not positively answer : but she did not know of any prepossession ; her eldest daughter , she must just mention : she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . \"\n",

      "\n",
      "mr. denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr. wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps .\n",

      "\n",
      "the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation : a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming ; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street .\n",
      "\n",
      "on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities .\n",

      "\n",
      "both changed colour , one looked white , the other red .\n",

      "\n",
      "she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself , however , might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice .\n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding ; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other ; of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr. denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the  :  : shire .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the officers , mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance ; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing ; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. phillips , and was by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin .\n",

      "the moment of her release from him was ecstasy .\n",
      "\n",
      "she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked .\n",
      "\n",
      "when those dances were over , she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him .\n",
      "\n",
      "he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind ; charlotte tried to console her: \" i dare say you will find him very agreeable . \"\n",

      "when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper , not to be a simpleton , and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks , their equal amazement in beholding it .\n",
      "\n",
      "they stood for some time without speaking a word ; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it ; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance .\n",
      "\n",
      "he replied , and was again silent .\n",

      "\n",
      "it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ; and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged , as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" both , \" replied elizabeth archly ; \" for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds .\n",
      "\n",
      "we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , \" said he .\n",

      "the effect was immediate .\n",
      "\n",
      "a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on .\n",
      "\n",
      "at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , \" mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends : whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , \" replied elizabeth with emphasis , \" and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject .\n",
      "\n",
      "at that moment , sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room ; but on perceiving mr. darcy , he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner .\n",

      "\n",
      "the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy ; but sir william's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together .\n",
      "\n",
      "recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , \" sir william's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . \"\n",

      "\n",
      "said he , with a look of doubt .\n",

      "i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" i can readily believe , \" answered he gravely , \" that reports may vary greatly with respect to me ; and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , \" he coldly replied .\n",
      "\n",
      "she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence ; and on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another .\n",
      "\n",
      "they had not long separated , when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her: \" so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham !\n",

      "your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you , among his other communication , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr. darcy's steward .\n",
      "\n",
      "let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to mr. darcy's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has always been remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner .\n",
      "\n",
      "i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way .\n",
      "\n",
      "his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it .\n",
      "\n",
      "i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite's guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , \" said elizabeth angrily ; \" for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy's steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" i beg your pardon , \" replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer .\n",

      "\n",
      "jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and everything else , gave way before the hope of jane's being in the fairest way for happiness .\n",

      "\" i want to know , \" said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's , \" what you have learnt about mr. wickham .\n",

      "mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity , and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received ; and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's , mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man .\n",
      "\n",
      "i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr. darcy's regard . \"\n",

      "\n",
      "\" i have not a doubt of mr. bingley's sincerity , \" said elizabeth warmly ; \" but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only .\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one , i dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr. bingley's regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it .\n",
      "\n",
      "on their being joined by mr. bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas ; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr. collins came up to them , and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" i have found out , \" said he , \" by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness .\n",

      "\n",
      "i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before .\n",

      "it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme , assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt ; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side ; and that if it were , it must belong to mr. darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance .\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and , when she ceased speaking , replied thus: \" my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding ; but permit me to say , that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom : provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained .\n",

      "\n",
      "it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man .\n",

      "mr. collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr. darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way .\n",

      "\n",
      "as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley ; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane .\n",
      "\n",
      "she saw her in idea settled in that very house , in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow ; and she felt capable , under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley's two sisters .\n",

      "\n",
      "it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men ; and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette ; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life .\n",

      "jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation ; but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham ; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs .\n",

      "\n",
      "but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . \"\n",

      "\n",
      "jane's temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart .\n",
      "\n",
      "they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct ; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together .\n",
      "\n",
      "after lamenting it , however , at some length , she had the consolation that mr. bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration , that though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses .\n",

      "this was very amiable , but charlotte's kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of ; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr. collins's addresses , by engaging them towards herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "such was miss lucas's scheme ; and appearances were so favourable , that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon .\n",
      "\n",
      "but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise ; for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday .\n",

      "\n",
      "in as short a time as mr. collins's long speeches would allow , everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both ; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men ; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness .\n",
      "\n",
      "the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance ; and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained .\n",

      "\n",
      "lady lucas began directly to calculate , with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live ; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st . james's .\n",

      "the whole family , in short , were properly overjoyed on the occasion .\n",

      "\n",
      "without thinking highly either of men or matrimony , marriage had always been her object ; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want .\n",

      "this preservative she had now obtained ; and at the age of twenty-seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it .\n",

      "\n",
      "a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty ; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love .\n",
      "\n",
      "as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night ; and mrs. bennet , with great politeness and cordiality , said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them .\n",

      "\" i see what you are feeling , \" replied charlotte .\n",

      "elizabeth quietly answered \" undoubtedly ; \" and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family .\n",

      "\n",
      "it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match .\n",
      "\n",
      "the strangeness of mr. collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted .\n",
      "\n",
      "she had always felt that charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she had not supposed it to be possible that , when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage .\n",
      "\n",
      "charlotte the wife of mr. collins was a most humiliating picture !\n",
      "\n",
      "and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter , to announce her engagement to the family .\n",
      "\n",
      "with many compliments to them , and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter : to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous ; for mrs. bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken ; and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed: \" good lord !\n",

      "sir william , how can you tell such a story ?\n",
      "\n",
      "do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy ? \"\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment ; but sir william's good breeding carried him through it all ; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself ; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr. collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london .\n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained ; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter ; secondly , she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in ; thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together ; and fourthly , that the match might be broken off .\n",
      "\n",
      "two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole: one , that elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief ; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all ; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day .\n",
      "\n",
      "nothing could console and nothing could appease her .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor did that day wear out her resentment .\n",
      "\n",
      "a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter .\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort ; for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter !\n",
      "\n",
      "jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match ; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness ; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable .\n",
      "\n",
      "kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr. collins was only a clergyman ; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton .\n",
      "\n",
      "lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married ; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs. bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away .\n",
      "\n",
      "between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject ; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again .\n",
      "\n",
      "her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return .\n",
      "\n",
      "jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again .\n",
      "\n",
      "the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted .\n",
      "\n",
      "after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight ; for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men .\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. collins's return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet .\n",
      "\n",
      "on the contrary , she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge ; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome .\n",
      "\n",
      "she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable .\n",

      "\n",
      "day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter ; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood .\n",
      "\n",
      "even elizabeth began to fear : not that bingley was indifferent : but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away .\n",
      "\n",
      "unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane's happiness , and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently occurring .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "as for jane , her anxiety under this suspense was , of course , more painful than elizabeth's , but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to .\n",
      "\n",
      "but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used .\n",

      "\n",
      "nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural ; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy .\n",

      "they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house ; and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time , with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory ; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him .\n",
      "\n",
      "but though everything seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance , and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion .\n",

      "\n",
      "after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey , and of all that had happened in london , mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures ; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible .\n",
      "\n",
      "here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind .\n",
      "\n",
      "he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump .\n",
      "\n",
      "but of all the views which his garden , or which the country or kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground .\n",
      "\n",
      "from his garden , mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows ; but the ladies , not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back ; and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was rather small , but well built and convenient ; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit .\n",
      "\n",
      "when mr. collins could be forgotten , there was really an air of great comfort throughout , and by charlotte's evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten .\n",
      "\n",
      "she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr. collins joining in , observed: \" yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her .\n",

      "\n",
      "the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had already been written ; and when it closed , elizabeth , in the solitude of her chamber , had to meditate upon charlotte's degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with , her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well .\n",
      "\n",
      "she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr. collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings .\n",

      "a lively imagination soon settled it all .\n",
      "\n",
      "about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion ; and , after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her .\n",

      "she opened the door and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out :  \" oh , my dear eliza !\n",

      "every park has its beauty and its prospects ; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh .\n",

      "in spite of having been at st . james's , sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word ; and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look .\n",

      "the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised ; and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship's desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater .\n",

      "\n",
      "she inquired into charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all ; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry .\n",

      "while sir william was with them , mr. collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig , and showing him the country ; but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing , and looking out of the window in his own book-room , which fronted the road .\n",

      "elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use ; it was a better sized room , and had a more pleasant aspect ; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively ; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement .\n",
      "\n",
      "from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day .\n",
      "\n",
      "she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out .\n",
      "\n",
      "very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise ; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours .\n",
      "\n",
      "now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits .\n",
      "\n",
      "she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently ; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture ; or detected the housemaid in negligence ; and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins's joints of meat were too large for her family .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth soon perceived , that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins ; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented , or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty .\n",
      "\n",
      "the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week ; and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card-table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first .\n",

      "their other engagements were few , as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr. collins's reach .\n",
      "\n",
      "this , however , was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough ; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors .\n",
      "\n",
      "her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine's curiosity .\n",
      "\n",
      "in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away .\n",
      "\n",
      "easter was approaching , and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr. darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley's designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine , who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "his arrival was soon known at the parsonage ; for mr. collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it , and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence .\n",
      "\n",
      "on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects .\n",
      "\n",
      "there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle lord  :  :  , and , to the great surprise of all the party , when mr. collins returned , the gentlemen accompanied him .\n",
      "\n",
      "charlotte had seen them from her husband's room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding: \" i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility .\n",

      "elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word .\n",
      "\n",
      "colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man , and talked very pleasantly ; but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs. collins , sat for some time without speaking to anybody .\n",

      "at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family .\n",

      "\n",
      "she was perfectly sensible that he never had ; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane , and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet .\n",

      "the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away .\n",
      "\n",

      "it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither : for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary ; and it was not till easter-day , almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening .\n",

      "\n",
      "her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else ; and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them ; anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings ; and mrs. collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much .\n",
      "\n",
      "he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before ; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr. darcy .\n",
      "\n",
      "his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity ; and that her ladyship , after a while , shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out: \" what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ?\n",

      "\n",
      "all field sports were over .\n",
      "\n",
      "within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard-table , but gentlemen cannot always be within doors ; and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day .\n",

      "they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt .\n",
      "\n",

      "he seldom appeared really animated .\n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. collins knew not what to make of him .\n",
      "\n",
      "colonel fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her ; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love , and the object of that love her friend eliza , she set herself seriously to work to find it out .\n",
      "\n",
      "she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford ; but without much success .\n",
      "\n",
      "he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind .\n",
      "\n",
      "she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea ; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment ; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend's dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power .\n",
      "\n",
      "in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man ; he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible ; but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all .\n",

      "\n",
      "yet it did , and even a third .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much ; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions : about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr. and mrs. collins's happiness ; and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too .\n",
      "\n",
      "his words seemed to imply it .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "she was engaged one day as she walked , in perusing jane's last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her .\n",
      "\n",
      "putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said: \" i did not know before that you ever walked this way . \"\n",

      "in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive ; till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and , when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said: \" in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned .\n",

      "elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment ; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said: \" you are mistaken , mr. darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . \"\n",

      "she went on: \" from the very beginning : from the first moment , i may almost say : of my acquaintance with you , your manners , impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry . \"\n",

      "\n",
      "she continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte's observation , and hurried her away to her room .\n",

      "\n",
      "she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr. darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led farther from the turnpike-road .\n",
      "\n",
      "the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground .\n",
      "\n",
      "after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park .\n",

      "she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park ; he was moving that way ; and , fearful of its being mr. darcy , she was directly retreating .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name .\n",
      "\n",
      "she had turned away ; but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy , she moved again towards the gate .\n",
      "\n",
      "he had by that time reached it also , and , holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said , with a look of haughty composure , \" i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you .\n",
      "\n",
      "will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? \"\n",
      "\n",
      "and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight .\n",
      "\n",
      "with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and , to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper , written quite through , in a very close hand .\n",
      "\n",
      "the envelope itself was likewise full .\n",
      "\n",
      "pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was dated from rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows: :  \" be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you .\n",
      "\n",
      "i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read .\n",
      "\n",
      "you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention ; your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice .\n",

      "\" two offenses of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge .\n",
      "\n",
      "the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr. bingley from your sister , and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham .\n",
      "\n",
      "wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison .\n",
      "\n",
      "but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in the future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read .\n",

      "\n",
      "her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment .\n",

      "to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate ; and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of  :  :  , in hertfordshire ; and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet's carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman's punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs .\n",

      "i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe .\n",
      "\n",
      "his fear of her has always operated , i know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head .\n",
      "\n",
      "she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him .\n",
      "\n",
      "the rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth ; and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again .\n",
      "\n",
      "when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic .\n",
      "\n",
      "kitty was the only one who shed tears ; but she did weep from vexation and envy .\n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible : advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to ; and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard .\n",
      "\n",
      "had elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort .\n",
      "\n",
      "her father , captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her .\n",
      "\n",
      "respect , esteem , and confidence had vanished for ever ; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown .\n",
      "\n",
      "but mr. bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was fond of the country and of books ; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments .\n",
      "\n",
      "to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement .\n",
      "\n",
      "this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband .\n",
      "\n",
      "she had always seen it with pain ; but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible .\n",
      "\n",
      "but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ; talents , which , rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife .\n",
      "\n",
      "when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham's departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment .\n",
      "\n",
      "their parties abroad were less varied than before , and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle ; and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp .\n",
      "\n",
      "upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not , in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity : to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment .\n",
      "\n",
      "her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts ; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable ; and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" but it is fortunate , \" thought she , \" that i have something to wish for .\n",
      "\n",
      "were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain .\n",
      "\n",
      "but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised .\n",
      "\n",
      "a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty ; but her letters were always long expected , and always very short .\n",
      "\n",
      "those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild ; that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs. forster called her , and they were going off to the camp ; and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt : for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public .\n",
      "\n",
      "after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour , and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn .\n",
      "\n",
      "everything wore a happier aspect .\n",
      "\n",
      "the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose .\n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity ; and , by the middle of june , kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears ; an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless , by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton .\n",
      "\n",
      "the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching , and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs. gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent .\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month , and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour , and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire .\n",
      "\n",
      "in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks ; and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction .\n",
      "\n",
      "the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth was excessively disappointed ; she had set her heart on seeing the lakes , and still thought there might have been time enough .\n",
      "\n",
      "but it was her business to be satisfied : and certainly her temper to be happy ; and all was soon right again .\n",
      "\n",
      "with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" but surely , \" said she , \" i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "the period of expectation was now doubled .\n",
      "\n",
      "four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival .\n",
      "\n",
      "but they did pass away , and mr. and mrs. gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn .\n",
      "\n",
      "the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way : teaching them , playing with them , and loving them .\n",
      "\n",
      "the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement .\n",
      "\n",
      "one enjoyment was certain : that of suitableness of companions ; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences : cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure : and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenilworth , birmingham , etc .\n",

      "are sufficiently known .\n",
      "\n",
      "a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern .\n",
      "\n",
      "to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs. gardiner's former residence , and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country ; and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "in talking over their route the evening before , mrs. gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again .\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? \"\n",
      "\n",
      "said her aunt ; \" a place , too , with which so many of your acquaintances are connected .\n",
      "\n",
      "wickham passed all his youth there , you know . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth was distressed .\n",
      "\n",
      "she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it .\n",
      "\n",
      "she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses ; after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains .\n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , \" said she , \" i should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful .\n",
      "\n",
      "they have some of the finest woods in the country . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth said no more : but her mind could not acquiesce .\n",
      "\n",
      "the possibility of meeting mr. darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred .\n",
      "\n",
      "it would be dreadful !\n",
      "\n",
      "she blushed at the very idea , and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk .\n",
      "\n",
      "but against this there were objections ; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered .\n",
      "\n",
      "accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place ?\n",
      "\n",
      "what was the name of its proprietor ?\n",
      "\n",
      "and , with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer ?\n",
      "\n",
      "a most welcome negative followed the last question : and her alarms now being removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself ; and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme .\n",
      "\n",
      "to pemberley , therefore , they were to go .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation ; and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter .\n",
      "\n",
      "the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground .\n",
      "\n",
      "they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view .\n",
      "\n",
      "they gradually ascended for half-a-mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a large , handsome stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills ; and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance .\n",
      "\n",
      "its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth was delighted .\n",
      "\n",
      "she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste .\n",
      "\n",
      "they were all of them warm in their admiration ; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something !\n",
      "\n",
      "they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door ; and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned .\n",
      "\n",
      "she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken .\n",
      "\n",
      "on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall ; and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was .\n",
      "\n",
      "the housekeeper came ; a respectable-looking elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her .\n",
      "\n",
      "they followed her into the dining-parlour .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a large , well proportioned room , handsomely fitted up .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect .\n",
      "\n",
      "the hill , crowned with wood , which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object .\n",
      "\n",
      "every disposition of the ground was good ; and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight .\n",
      "\n",
      "as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions ; but from every window there were beauties to be seen .\n",
      "\n",
      "the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor ; but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine ; with less of splendour , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" and of this place , \" thought she , \" i might have been mistress !\n",
      "\n",
      "with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted !\n",
      "\n",
      "instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt .\n",
      "\n",
      "but no , \"  : recollecting herself :  \" that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; i should not have been allowed to invite them . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "this was a lucky recollection : it saved her from something very like regret .\n",
      "\n",
      "she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent , but had not the courage for it .\n",
      "\n",
      "at length however , the question was asked by her uncle ; and she turned away with alarm , while mrs. reynolds replied that he was , adding , \" but we expect him to-morrow , with a large party of friends . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day !\n",
      "\n",
      "her aunt now called her to look at a picture .\n",
      "\n",
      "she approached and saw the likeness of mr. wickham , suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantelpiece .\n",
      "\n",
      "her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it .\n",
      "\n",
      "the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master's steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expense .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" he is now gone into the army , \" she added ; \" but i am afraid he has turned out very wild . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" and that , \" said mrs. reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , \" is my master : and very like him .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\" i have heard much of your master's fine person , \" said mrs. gardiner , looking at the picture ; \" it is a handsome face .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master .\n",

      "as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship !  : how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow !  : how much of good or evil must be done by him !\n",
      "\n",
      "every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before ; she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression .\n",

      "they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family .\n",
      "\n",
      "amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment ; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor did he seem much more at ease ; when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness ; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her having stayed in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts .\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "and his behaviour , so strikingly altered : what could it mean ?\n",

      "that he should even speak to her was amazing !  : but to speak with such civility , to inquire after her family !\n",

      "they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching ; but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it ; and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene .\n",
      "\n",
      "her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr. darcy then was .\n",

      "\n",
      "at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds ; when , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream .\n",

      "\n",
      "they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene ; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited ; and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth longed to explore its windings ; but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs. gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible .\n",
      "\n",
      "her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction ; but their progress was slow , for mr. gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little .\n",
      "\n",
      "whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr. darcy approaching them , and at no great distance .\n",

      "he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it \" was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; \" and , before she could reply , he added , \" it is above eight months .\n",
      "\n",
      "we have not met since the 26th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact ; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at longbourn .\n",
      "\n",
      "there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark ; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself ; but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day .\n",
      "\n",
      "when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace : when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage : the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible .\n",
      "\n",
      "never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve , as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings .\n",
      "\n",
      "their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour ; and when they arose to depart , mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country .\n",
      "\n",
      "miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed .\n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head .\n",
      "\n",
      "presuming however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on .\n",
      "\n",
      "bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased , and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little .\n",
      "\n",
      "eager to be alone , and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress .\n",
      "\n",
      "but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner's curiosity ; it was not their wish to force her communication .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of ; it was evident that he was very much in love with her .\n",
      "\n",
      "they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify inquiry .\n",
      "\n",
      "of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well ; and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find .\n",
      "\n",
      "they could not be untouched by his politeness ; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr. darcy .\n",
      "\n",
      "there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper ; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected .\n",
      "\n",
      "neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight .\n",
      "\n",
      "they had nothing to accuse him of but pride ; pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor .\n",
      "\n",
      "with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation ; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well-known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr. darcy afterwards discharged .\n",
      "\n",
      "as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last ; and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion ; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out .\n",
      "\n",
      "she certainly did not hate him .\n",
      "\n",
      "no ; hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called .\n",
      "\n",
      "the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling ; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced .\n",
      "\n",
      "but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was gratitude ; gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection .\n",
      "\n",
      "he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude : for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed ; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined .\n",
      "\n",
      "she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare ; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses .\n",
      "\n",
      "it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side ; and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "they were , therefore , to go .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth was pleased ; though when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply .\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast .\n",
      "\n",
      "the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon .\n",
      "\n",
      "convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed .\n",
      "\n",
      "on reaching the house , they were shown through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer .\n",
      "\n",
      "its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn .\n",
      "\n",
      "in this house they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs. hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london .\n",
      "\n",
      "georgiana's reception of them was very civil , but attended with all the embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved .\n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her .\n",
      "\n",
      "by mrs. hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey ; and , on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was first broken by mrs. annesley , a genteel , agreeable-looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others ; and between her and mrs. gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on .\n",
      "\n",
      "miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it ; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention .\n",
      "\n",
      "this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance ; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much .\n",
      "\n",
      "her own thoughts were employing her .\n",
      "\n",
      "she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them ; and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine .\n",
      "\n",
      "after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley's voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family .\n",
      "\n",
      "she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more .\n",
      "\n",
      "the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season ; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post .\n",
      "\n",
      "there was now employment for the whole party : for though they could not all talk , they could all eat ; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches soon collected them round the table .\n",
      "\n",
      "while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room ; and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came .\n",
      "\n",
      "he had been some time with mr. gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed ; a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room .\n",
      "\n",
      "in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley's , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects ; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr. darcy were by no means over .\n",
      "\n",
      "miss darcy , on her brother's entrance , exerted herself much more to talk , and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side .\n",
      "\n",
      "miss bingley saw all this likewise ; and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility: \" pray , miss eliza , are not the  :  : shire militia removed from meryton ?\n",
      "\n",
      "they must be a great loss to your family . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "in darcy's presence she dared not mention wickham's name ; but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts ; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress ; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone .\n",
      "\n",
      "while she spoke , an involuntary glance showed her darcy , with a heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes .\n",
      "\n",
      "had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint ; but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy's opinion , and , perhaps , to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps .\n",
      "\n",
      "not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy's meditated elopement .\n",
      "\n",
      "to no creature had it been revealed , where secrecy was possible , except to elizabeth ; and from all bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from the very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own .\n",
      "\n",
      "he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth's collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion ; and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more .\n",
      "\n",
      "her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully .\n",
      "\n",
      "their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned ; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth's person , behaviour , and dress .\n",
      "\n",
      "but georgiana would not join her .\n",
      "\n",
      "her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour ; his judgement could not err .\n",
      "\n",
      "and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable .\n",
      "\n",
      "when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning , mr. darcy , \" she cried ; \" i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter .\n",
      "\n",
      "she is grown so brown and coarse !\n",
      "\n",
      "louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" for my own part , \" she rejoined , \" i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her .\n",
      "\n",
      "her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome .\n",
      "\n",
      "her nose wants character : there is nothing marked in its lines .\n",
      "\n",
      "her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i could never see anything extraordinary in them .\n",
      "\n",
      "they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all ; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself ; but angry people are not always wise ; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was resolutely silent , however , and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued: \" i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , 'she a beauty !  : i should as soon call her mother a wit . '\n",
      "\n",
      "but afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" yes , \" replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , \" but that was only when i first saw her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself .\n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both .\n",
      "\n",
      "the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention .\n",
      "\n",
      "they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit : of everything but himself ; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of him , and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton ; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there ; but on the third her repining was over , and her sister justified , by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere .\n",
      "\n",
      "elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill .\n",
      "\n",
      "they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in ; and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves .\n",
      "\n",
      "the one missent must first be attended to ; it had been written five days ago .\n",
      "\n",
      "the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded ; but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was to this effect: \" since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but i am afraid of alarming you : be assured that we are all well .\n",
      "\n",
      "what i have to say relates to poor lydia .\n",
      "\n",
      "an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with wickham !\n",

      "imagine our surprise .\n",
      "\n",
      "to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected .\n",

      "i am very , very sorry .\n",
      "\n",
      "so imprudent a match on both sides !\n",

      "\n",
      "thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart .\n",
      "\n",
      "his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing .\n",

      "\n",
      "such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them .\n",
      "\n",
      "it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support ; and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy's marriage ; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment ; was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth .\n",

      "lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew ; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end .\n",
      "\n",
      "but at length , by elizabeth's persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation ; and , after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself ; and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city .\n",

      "\n",
      "chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity .\n",
      "\n",
      "then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk ; the undeliverable , nameless perils of the whale ; these , with all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds , helped to sway me to my wish .\n",

      "\n",
      "as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford , thence to embark on their voyage , it may as well be related that i , for one , had no idea of so doing .\n",
      "\n",
      "for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft , because there was a fine , boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island , which amazingly pleased me .\n",
      "\n",
      "besides though new bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling , and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her , yet nantucket was her great original—the tyre of this carthage ; —the place where the first dead american whale was stranded .\n",

      "\n",
      "now having a night , a day , and still another night following before me in new bedford , ere i could embark for my destined port , it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a very dubious , looking , nay , a very dark and dismal night , bitingly cold and cheerless .\n",
      "\n",
      "i knew no one in the place .\n",
      "\n",
      "with anxious grapnels i had sounded my pocket , and only brought up a few pieces of silver , —so , wherever you go , ishmael , said i to myself , as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag , and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night , my dear ishmael , be sure to inquire the price , and don't be too particular .\n",
      "\n",
      "with halting steps i paced the streets , and passed the sign of \" the crossed harpoons \" —but it looked too expensive and jolly there .\n",
      "\n",
      "further on , from the bright red windows of the \" sword , fish inn , \" there came such fervent rays , that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house , for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard , asphaltic pavement , —rather weary for me , when i struck my foot against the flinty projections , because from hard , remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight .\n",

      "i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward , for there , doubtless , were the cheapest , if not the cheeriest inns .\n",
      "\n",
      "such dreary streets !\n",
      "\n",
      "blocks of blackness , not houses , on either hand , and here and there a candle , like a candle moving about in a tomb .\n",
      "\n",
      "at this hour of the night , of the last day of the week , that quarter of the town proved all but deserted .\n",
      "\n",

      "it had a careless look , as if it were meant for the uses of the public ; so , entering , the first thing i did was to stumble over an ash , box in the porch .\n",

      "\n",

      "a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer ; and beyond , a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "moving on , i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks , and heard a forlorn creaking in the air ; and looking up , saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it , faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray , and these words underneath— \" the spouter inn:—peter coffin . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "coffin ? —spouter ? —rather ominous in that particular connexion , thought i .\n",

      "\n",
      "as the light looked so dim , and the place , for the time , looked quiet enough , and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district , and as the swinging sign had a poverty , stricken sort of creak to it , i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings , and the best of pea coffee .\n",

      "\n",
      "but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long , limber , portentous , black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue , dim , perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast .\n",
      "\n",
      "a boggy , soggy , squitchy picture truly , enough to drive a nervous man distracted .\n",

      "but at length all the past night's events soberly recurred , one by one , in fixed reality , and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament .\n",
      "\n",
      "for though i tried to move his arm—unlock his bridegroom clasp—yet , sleeping as he was , he still hugged me tightly , as though naught but death should part us twain .\n",

      "throwing aside the counterpane , there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage's side , as if it were a hatchet , faced baby .\n",

      "\n",
      "at length , by dint of much wriggling , and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style , i succeeded in extracting a grunt ; and presently , he drew back his arm , shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water , and sat up in bed , stiff as a pike , staff , looking at me , and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there , though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him .\n",
      "\n",
      "meanwhile , i lay quietly eyeing him , having no serious misgivings now , and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature .\n",
      "\n",
      "when , at last , his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow , and he became , as it were , reconciled to the fact ; he jumped out upon the floor , and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that , if it pleased me , he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards , leaving the whole apartment to myself .\n",
      "\n",
      "thinks i , queequeg , under the circumstances , this is a very civilized overture ; but , the truth is , these savages have an innate sense of delicacy , say what you will ; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are .\n",
      "\n",
      "i pay this particular compliment to queequeg , because he treated me with so much civility and consideration , while i was guilty of great rudeness ; staring at him from the bed , and watching all his toilette motions ; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding .\n",
      "\n",
      "nevertheless , a man like queequeg you don't see every day , he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding .\n",
      "\n",
      "he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat , a very tall one , by the by , and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his boots .\n",
      "\n",
      "what under the heavens he did it for , i cannot tell , but his next movement was to crush himself—boots in hand , and hat on—under the bed ; when , from sundry violent gaspings and strainings , i inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of , is any man required to be private when putting on his boots .\n",
      "\n",
      "but queequeg , do you see , was a creature in the transition stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners .\n",
      "\n",
      "his education was not yet completed .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was an undergraduate .\n",
      "\n",
      "if he had not been a small degree civilized , he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all ; but then , if he had not been still a savage , he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on .\n",
      "\n",
      "at last , he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes , and began creaking and limping about the room , as if , not being much accustomed to boots , his pair of damp , wrinkled cowhide ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "seeing , now , that there were no curtains to the window , and that the street being very narrow , the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room , and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made , staving about with little else but his hat and boots on ; i begged him as well as i could , to accelerate his toilet somewhat , and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible .\n",
      "\n",
      "he complied , and then proceeded to wash himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face ; but queequeg , to my amazement , contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest , arms , and hands .\n",
      "\n",
      "he then donned his waistcoat , and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash , stand centre table , dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face .\n",
      "\n",
      "i was watching to see where he kept his razor , when lo and behold , he takes the harpoon from the bed corner , slips out the long wooden stock , unsheathes the head , whets it a little on his boot , and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall , begins a vigorous scraping , or rather harpooning of his cheeks .\n",
      "\n",
      "thinks i , queequeg , this is using rogers's best cutlery with a vengeance .\n",
      "\n",
      "afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made , and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept .\n",
      "\n",
      "the rest of his toilet was soon achieved , and he proudly marched out of the room , wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket , and sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton .\n",
      "\n",
      "i quickly followed suit , and descending into the bar , room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly .\n",
      "\n",
      "i cherished no malice towards him , though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow .\n",
      "\n",
      "however , a good laugh is a mighty good thing , and rather too scarce a good thing ; the more's the pity .\n",
      "\n",
      "so , if any one man , in his own proper person , afford stuff for a good joke to anybody , let him not be backward , but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way .\n",

      "and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him , be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for .\n",
      "\n",
      "the bar , room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous , and whom i had not as yet had a good look at .\n",
      "\n",
      "they were nearly all whalemen ; chief mates , and second mates , and third mates , and sea carpenters , and sea coopers , and sea blacksmiths , and harpooneers , and ship keepers ; a brown and brawny company , with bosky beards ; an unshorn , shaggy set , all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns .\n",

      "in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn , but slightly bleached withal ; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore .\n",
      "\n",
      "but who could show a cheek like queequeg ?\n",
      "\n",

      "now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we went to breakfast .\n",

      "not always , though: ledyard , the great new england traveller , and mungo park , the scotch one ; of all men , they possessed the least assurance in the parlor .\n",
      "\n",
      "but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did , or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach , in the negro heart of africa , which was the sum of poor mungo's performances—this kind of travel , i say , may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish .\n",
      "\n",
      "still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere .\n",
      "\n",
      "these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise , nearly every man maintained a profound silence .\n",

      "\n",
      "yes , here were a set of sea , dogs , many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire strangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking ; and yet , here they sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling , all of kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains .\n",

      "\n",
      "but that was certainly very coolly done by him , and every one knows that in most people's estimation , to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly .\n",

      "we will not speak of all queequeg's peculiarities here ; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls , and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks , done rare .\n",

      "enough , that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room , lighted his tomahawk , pipe , and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on , when i sallied out for a stroll .\n",
      "\n",
      "if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town , that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford .\n",

      "\n",
      "no one having previously heard his history , could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest , because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him , imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led .\n",
      "\n",
      "when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella , and certainly had not come in his carriage , for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet , and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed .\n",
      "\n",
      "however , hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed , and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner ; when , arrayed in a decent suit , he quietly approached the pulpit .\n",
      "\n",
      "like most old fashioned pulpits , it was a very lofty one , and since a regular stairs to such a height would , by its long angle with the floor , seriously contract the already small area of the chapel , the architect , it seemed , had acted upon the hint of father mapple , and finished the pulpit without a stairs , substituting a perpendicular side ladder , like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man , ropes for this ladder , which , being itself nicely headed , and stained with a mahogany colour , the whole contrivance , considering what manner of chapel it was , seemed by no means in bad taste .\n",
      "\n",
      "halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder , and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man , ropes , father mapple cast a look upwards , and then with a truly sailor , like but still reverential dexterity , hand over hand , mounted the steps as if ascending the main , top of his vessel .\n",
      "\n",
      "the perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case with swinging ones , were of cloth , covered rope , only the rounds were of wood , so that at every step there was a joint .\n",
      "\n",
      "at my first glimpse of the pulpit , it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship , these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary .\n",
      "\n",
      "for i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height , slowly turn round , and stooping over the pulpit , deliberately drag up the ladder step by step , till the whole was deposited within , leaving him impregnable in his little quebec .\n",
      "\n",
      "i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this .\n",
      "\n",
      "father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity , that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage .\n",
      "\n",
      "no , thought i , there must be some sober reason for this thing ; furthermore , it must symbolize something unseen .\n",
      "\n",
      "can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties and connexions ?\n",
      "\n",
      "yes , for replenished with the meat and wine of the word , to the faithful man of god , this pulpit , i see , is a self , containing stronghold—a lofty ehrenbreitstein , with a perennial well of water within the walls .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place , borrowed from the chaplain's former sea , farings .\n",
      "\n",
      "between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers .\n",
      "\n",
      "but high above the flying scud and dark , rolling clouds , there floated a little isle of sunlight , from which beamed forth an angel's face ; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship's tossed deck , something like that silver plate now inserted into the victory's plank where nelson fell .\n",

      "\n",
      "its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship's bluff bows , and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work , fashioned after a ship's fiddle , headed beak .\n",

      "this ended , in prolonged solemn tones , like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he commenced reading the following hymn ; but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas , burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy— \" the ribs and terrors in the whale , arched over me a dismal gloom , while all god's sun , lit waves rolled by , and lift me deepening down to doom .\n",

      "now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko , and its commander—from all accounts , a very stately punctilious gentleman , at least for a sea captain—this commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg's sister , a pretty young princess just turned of ten .\n",
      "\n",
      "well ; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage , this captain marches in , and being assigned the post of honor , placed himself over against the punchbowl , and between the high priest and his majesty the king , queequeg's father .\n",

      "grace being said , —for those people have their grace as well as we—though queequeg told me that unlike us , who at such times look downwards to our platters , they , on the contrary , copying the ducks , glance upwards to the great giver of all feasts—grace , i say , being said , the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island ; that is , dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates .\n",
      "\n",
      "seeing himself placed next the priest , and noting the ceremony , and thinking himself—being captain of a ship—as having plain precedence over a mere island king , especially in the king's own house—the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl ; —taking it i suppose for a huge finger , glass .\n",

      "\n",
      "huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves , and side by side the world , wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last ; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers , with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch , all betokening that new cruises were on the start ; that one most perilous and long voyage ended , only begins a second ; and a second ended , only begins a third , and so on , for ever and for aye .\n",

      "what wonder , then , that these nantucketers , born on a beach , should take to the sea for a livelihood !\n",
      "\n",
      "they first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand ; grown bolder , they waded out with nets for mackerel ; more experienced , they pushed off in boats and captured cod ; and at last , launching a navy of great ships on the sea , explored this watery world ; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it ; peeped in at behring's straits ; and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood ; most monstrous and most mountainous !\n",

      "that himmalehan , salt , sea mastodon , clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power , that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults !\n",

      "and thus have these naked nantucketers , these sea hermits , issuing from their ant , hill in the sea , overrun and conquered the watery world like so many alexanders ; parcelling out among them the atlantic , pacific , and indian oceans , as the three pirate powers did poland .\n",

      "\n",
      "but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon queequeg , i was obliged to acquiesce ; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor , that should quickly settle that trifling little affair .\n",
      "\n",
      "next morning early , leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan , or day of fasting , humiliation , and prayer with queequeg and yojo that day ; how it was i never could find out , for , though i applied myself to it several times , i never could master his liturgies and xxxix articles—leaving queequeg , then , fasting on his tomahawk pipe , and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings , i sallied out among the shipping .\n",
      "\n",
      "after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries , i learnt that there were three ships up for three , years' voyages—the devil , dam , the tit , bit , and the pequod .\n",
      "\n",
      "devil , dam , i do not know the origin of ; tit , bit is obvious ; pequod , you will no doubt remember , was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians ; now extinct as the ancient medes .\n",
      "\n",
      "i peered and pryed about the devil , dam ; from her , hopped over to the tit , bit ; and finally , going on board the pequod , looked around her for a moment , and then decided that this was the very ship for us .\n",
      "\n",
      "you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day , for aught i know ; —square , toed luggers ; mountainous japanese junks ; butter , box galliots , and what not ; but take my word for it , you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old pequod .\n",
      "\n",
      "she was a ship of the old school , rather small if anything ; with an old , fashioned claw , footed look about her .\n",
      "\n",
      "long seasoned and weather , stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans , her old hull's complexion was darkened like a french grenadier's , who has alike fought in egypt and siberia .\n",
      "\n",
      "her venerable bows looked bearded .\n",
      "\n",
      "her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of japan , where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne .\n",
      "\n",
      "her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled , like the pilgrim , worshipped flag , stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled .\n",
      "\n",
      "but to all these her old antiquities , were added new and marvellous features , pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed .\n",
      "\n",
      "old captain peleg , many years her chief , mate , before he commanded another vessel of his own , and now a retired seaman , and one of the principal owners of the pequod , —this old peleg , during the term of his chief , mateship , had built upon her original grotesqueness , and inlaid it , all over , with a quaintness both of material and device , unmatched by anything except it be thorkill , hake's carved buckler or bedstead .\n",
      "\n",
      "she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor , his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory .\n",
      "\n",
      "she was a thing of trophies .\n",
      "\n",
      "a cannibal of a craft , tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies .\n",
      "\n",
      "all round , her unpanelled , open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw , with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale , inserted there for pins , to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to .\n",
      "\n",
      "those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood , but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea , ivory .\n",
      "\n",
      "scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm , she sported there a tiller ; and that tiller was in one mass , curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe .\n",
      "\n",
      "the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest , felt like the tartar , when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw .\n",

      "\n",
      "all noble things are touched with that .\n",
      "\n",
      "now when i looked about the quarter , deck , for some one having authority , in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage , at first i saw nobody ; but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent , or rather wigwam , pitched a little behind the main , mast .\n",
      "\n",
      "it seemed only a temporary erection used in port .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was of a conical shape , some ten feet high ; consisting of the long , huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right , whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "planted with their broad ends on the deck , a circle of these slabs laced together , mutually sloped towards each other , and at the apex united in a tufted point , where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top , knot on some old pottowottamie sachem's head .\n",
      "\n",
      "a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship , so that the insider commanded a complete view forward .\n",
      "\n",
      "and half concealed in this queer tenement , i at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority ; and who , it being noon , and the ship's work suspended , was now enjoying respite from the burden of command .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was seated on an old , fashioned oaken chair , wriggling all over with curious carving ; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed .\n",
      "\n",
      "there was nothing so very particular , perhaps , about the appearance of the elderly man i saw ; he was brown and brawny , like most old seamen , and heavily rolled up in blue pilot , cloth , cut in the quaker style ; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net , work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes , which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales , and always looking to windward ; —for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together .\n",

      "\n",
      "i was a little staggered , but go a , whaling i must , and i would ; and the pequod was as good a ship as any—i thought the best—and all this i now repeated to peleg .\n",

      "\n",
      "seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure .\n",
      "\n",
      "it turned out to be captain bildad , who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel ; the other shares , as is sometimes the case in these ports , being held by a crowd of old annuitants ; widows , fatherless children , and chancery wards ; each owning about the value of a timber head , or a foot of plank , or a nail or two in the ship .\n",
      "\n",
      "people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels , the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , bildad , like peleg , and indeed many other nantucketers , was a quaker , the island having been originally settled by that sect ; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the quaker , only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous .\n",

      "for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale , hunters .\n",
      "\n",
      "they are fighting quakers ; they are quakers with a vengeance .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that there are instances among them of men , who , named with scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom ; still , from the audacious , daring , and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives , strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities , a thousand bold dashes of character , not unworthy a scandinavian sea , king , or a poetical pagan roman .\n",
      "\n",
      "and when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force , with a globular brain and a ponderous heart ; who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long night , watches in the remotest waters , and beneath constellations never seen here at the north , been led to think untraditionally and independently ; receiving all nature's sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast , and thereby chiefly , but with some help from accidental advantages , to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes one in a whole nation's census—a mighty pageant creature , formed for noble tragedies .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor will it at all detract from him , dramatically regarded , if either by birth or other circumstances , he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature .\n",

      "\n",
      "be sure of this , o young ambition , all mortal greatness is but disease .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , as yet we have not to do with such an one , but with quite another ; and still a man , who , if indeed peculiar , it only results again from another phase of the quaker , modified by individual circumstances .\n",
      "\n",
      "like captain peleg , captain bildad was a well , to , do , retired whaleman .\n",
      "\n",

      "i began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the voyage .\n",
      "\n",
      "i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages ; but all hands , including the captain , received certain shares of the profits called lays , and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's company .\n",

      "i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling , my own lay would not be very large ; but considering that i was used to the sea , could steer a ship , splice a rope , and all that , i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is , the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage , whatever that might eventually amount to .\n",
      "\n",
      "and though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay , yet it was better than nothing ; and if we had a lucky voyage , might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it , not to speak of my three years' beef and board , for which i would not have to pay one stiver .\n",
      "\n",
      "it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune—and so it was , a very poor way indeed .\n",

      "\n",
      "but one thing , nevertheless , that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this: ashore , i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad ; how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod , therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners , left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two .\n",
      "\n",
      "and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands , especially as i now found him on board the pequod , quite at home there in the cabin , and reading his bible as if at his own fireside .\n",
      "\n",
      "now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack , knife , old bildad , to my no small surprise , considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings ; bildad never heeded us , but went on mumbling to himself out of his book , \" lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth— \" \" well , captain bildad , \" interrupted peleg , \" what d'ye say , what lay shall we give this young man ? \"\n",

      "\n",
      "at one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward's pantry ; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate's desk , where he kept his log ; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one's rheumatic back .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "nor was bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward .\n",
      "\n",
      "as for bildad , he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed , and at every fresh arrival , down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper .\n",

      "every once in a while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den , roaring at the men down the hatchways , roaring up to the riggers at the mast , head , and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam .\n",
      "\n",
      "during these days of preparation , queequeg and i often visited the craft , and as often i asked about captain ahab , and how he was , and when he was going to come on board his ship .\n",
      "\n",
      "to these questions they would answer , that he was getting better and better , and was expected aboard every day ; meantime , the two captains , peleg and bildad , could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage .\n",
      "\n",
      "if i had been downright honest with myself , i would have seen very plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage , without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it , so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "but when a man suspects any wrong , it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter , he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself .\n",

      "his pure tight skin was an excellent fit ; and closely wrapped up in it , and embalmed with inner health and strength , like a revivified egyptian , this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come , and to endure always , as now ; for be it polar snow or torrid sun , like a patent chronometer , his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates .\n",
      "\n",
      "looking into his eyes , you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand , fold perils he had calmly confronted through life .\n",

      "uncommonly conscientious for a seaman , and endued with a deep natural reverence , the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition ; but to that sort of superstition , which in some organizations seems rather to spring , somehow , from intelligence than from ignorance .\n",
      "\n",
      "outward portents and inward presentiments were his .\n",
      "\n",

      "starbuck was no crusader after perils ; in him courage was not a sentiment ; but a thing simply useful to him , and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions .\n",
      "\n",
      "besides , he thought , perhaps , that in this business of whaling , courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship , like her beef and her bread , and not to be foolishly wasted .\n",
      "\n",
      "wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun , down ; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him .\n",
      "\n",

      "with memories like these in him , and , moreover , given to a certain superstitiousness , as has been said ; the courage of this starbuck which could , nevertheless , still flourish , must indeed have been extreme .\n",
      "\n",
      "but it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized , and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had ; it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him , which , under suitable circumstances , would break out from its confinement , and burn all his courage up .\n",
      "\n",
      "and brave as he might be , it was that sort of bravery chiefly , visible in some intrepid men , which , while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas , or winds , or whales , or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world , yet cannot withstand those more terrific , because more spiritual terrors , which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man .\n",
      "\n",
      "but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance , the complete abasement of poor starbuck's fortitude , scarce might i have the heart to write it ; for it is a thing most sorrowful , nay shocking , to expose the fall of valour in the soul .\n",
      "\n",
      "men may seem detestable as joint stock , companies and nations ; knaves , fools , and murderers there may be ; men may have mean and meagre faces ; but man , in the ideal , is so noble and so sparkling , such a grand and glowing creature , that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes .\n",

      "\n",
      "good , humored , easy , and careless , he presided over his whale , boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner , and his crew all invited guests .\n",

      "he was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat , as an old stage , driver is about the snugness of his box .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "whether he ever thought of it at all , might be a question ; but , if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner , no doubt , like a good sailor , he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft , and bestir themselves there , about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order , and not sooner .\n",
      "\n",
      "what , perhaps , with other things , made stubb such an easy , going , unfearing man , so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars , all bowed to the ground with their packs ; what helped to bring about that almost impious good , humor of his ; that thing must have been his pipe .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , like his nose , his short , black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face .\n",
      "\n",
      "you would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe .\n",
      "\n",
      "he kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded , stuck in a rack , within easy reach of his hand ; and , whenever he turned in , he smoked them all out in succession , lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter ; then loading them again to be in readiness anew .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , when stubb dressed , instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers , he put his pipe into his mouth .\n",
      "\n",
      "i say this continual smoking must have been one cause , at least , of his peculiar disposition ; for every one knows that this earthly air , whether ashore or afloat , is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it ; and as in time of the cholera , some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths ; so , likewise , against all mortal tribulations , stubb's tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent .\n",

      "the third mate was flask , a native of tisbury , in martha's vineyard .\n",

      "a short , stout , ruddy young fellow , very pugnacious concerning whales , who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him ; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him , to destroy them whenever encountered .\n",
      "\n",
      "so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways ; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them ; that in his poor opinion , the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse , or at least water , rat , requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil .\n",
      "\n",
      "this ignorant , unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales ; he followed these fish for the fun of it ; and a three years' voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time .\n",
      "\n",
      "as a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails ; so mankind may be similarly divided .\n",

      "little flask was one of the wrought ones ; made to clinch tight and last long .\n",
      "\n",
      "they called him king , post on board of the pequod ; because , in form , he could be well likened to the short , square timber known by that name in arctic whalers ; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it , serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas .\n",
      "\n",
      "now these three mates—starbuck , stubb , and flask , were momentous men .\n",
      "\n",
      "they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the pequod's boats as headsmen .\n",

      "in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales , these three headsmen were as captains of companies .\n",
      "\n",
      "or , being armed with their long keen whaling spears , they were as a picked trio of lancers ; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins .\n",
      "\n",
      "and since in this famous fishery , each mate or headsman , like a gothic knight of old , is always accompanied by his boat , steerer or harpooneer , who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance , when the former one has been badly twisted , or elbowed in the assault ; and moreover , as there generally subsists between the two , a close intimacy and friendliness ; it is therefore but meet , that in this place we set down who the pequod's harpooneers were , and to what headsman each of them belonged .\n",
      "\n",

      "next was tashtego , an unmixed indian from gay head , the most westerly promontory of martha's vineyard , where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men , which has long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the fishery , they usually go by the generic name of gay , headers .\n",
      "\n",
      "tashtego's long , lean , sable hair , his high cheek bones , and black rounding eyes—for an indian , oriental in their largeness , but antarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters , who , in quest of the great new england moose , had scoured , bow in hand , the aboriginal forests of the main .\n",
      "\n",
      "but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland , tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea ; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires .\n",
      "\n",
      "to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs , you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans , and half , believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air .\n",
      "\n",
      "tashtego was stubb the second mate's squire .\n",
      "\n",
      "third among the harpooneers was daggoo , a gigantic , coal , black negro , savage , with a lion , like tread—an ahasuerus to behold .\n",
      "\n",
      "suspended from his ears were two golden hoops , so large that the sailors called them ring , bolts , and would talk of securing the top , sail halyards to them .\n",
      "\n",
      "in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler , lying in a lonely bay on his native coast .\n",
      "\n",
      "and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa , nantucket , and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen ; and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped ; daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues , and erect as a giraffe , moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks .\n",

      "behold the hope of him is vain !\n",
      "\n",
      "but i have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans ; i have had to do with whales with these visible hands ; i am in earnest ; and i will try .\n",
      "\n",
      "there are some preliminaries to settle .\n",
      "\n",
      "first: the uncertain , unsettled condition of this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact , that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish .\n",
      "\n",
      "in his system of nature , a . d . 1776 , linnæus declares , \" i hereby separate the whales from the fish . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "but of my own knowledge , i know that down to the year 1850 , sharks and shad , alewives and herring , against linnæus's express edict , were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan .\n",
      "\n",
      "the grounds upon which linnæus would fain have banished the whales from the waters , he states as follows: \" on account of their warm bilocular heart , their lungs , their movable eyelids , their hollow ears , penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem , \" and finally , \" ex lege naturæ jure meritoque . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley coffin , of nantucket , both messmates of mine in a certain voyage , and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient .\n",
      "\n",
      "charley profanely hinted they were humbug .\n",
      "\n",
      "be it known that , waiving all argument , i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish , and call upon holy jonah to back me .\n",
      "\n",
      "this fundamental thing settled , the next point is , in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish .\n",
      "\n",
      "above , linnæus has given you those items .\n",
      "\n",
      "but in brief , they are these: lungs and warm blood ; whereas , all other fish are lungless and cold blooded .\n",
      "\n",
      "next: how shall we define the whale , by his obvious externals , so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come ?\n",
      "\n",
      "to be short , then , a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail .\n",
      "\n",
      "there you have him .\n",
      "\n",
      "however contracted , that definition is the result of expanded meditation .\n",
      "\n",
      "a walrus spouts much like a whale , but the walrus is not a fish , because he is amphibious .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the last term of the definition is still more cogent , as coupled with the first .\n",
      "\n",
      "almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat , but a vertical , or up , and , down tail .\n",
      "\n",
      "whereas , among spouting fish the tail , though it may be similarly shaped , invariably assumes a horizontal position .\n",
      "\n",
      "by the above definition of what a whale is , i do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed nantucketers ; nor , on the other hand , link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien .\n",
      "\n",
      "* hence , all the smaller , spouting , and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground , plan of cetology .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , then , come the grand divisions of the entire whale host .\n",
      "\n",
      "*i am aware that down to the present time , the fish styled lamatins and dugongs ( pig , fish and sow , fish of the coffins of nantucket ) are included by many naturalists among the whales .\n",
      "\n",
      "but as these pig , fish are a noisy , contemptible set , mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers , and feeding on wet hay , and especially as they do not spout , i deny their credentials as whales ; and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology .\n",

      "\n",
      "he is , without doubt , the largest inhabitant of the globe ; the most formidable of all whales to encounter ; the most majestic in aspect ; and lastly , by far the most valuable in commerce ; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance , spermaceti , is obtained .\n",

      "all his peculiarities will , in many other places , be enlarged upon .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do .\n",
      "\n",
      "philologically considered , it is absurd .\n",
      "\n",
      "some centuries ago , when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality , and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish ; in those days spermaceti , it would seem , was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland or right whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was the idea also , that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses .\n",
      "\n",
      "in those times , also , spermaceti was exceedingly scarce , not being used for light , but only as an ointment and medicament .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb .\n",
      "\n",
      "when , as i opine , in the course of time , the true nature of spermaceti became known , its original name was still retained by the dealers ; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity .\n",
      "\n",
      "and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived .\n",
      "\n",
      "the most venerable of the leviathans , being the one first regularly hunted by man .\n",
      "\n",
      "it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen ; and the oil specially known as \" whale oil , \" an inferior article in commerce .\n",
      "\n",
      "among the fishermen , he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles: the whale ; the greenland whale ; the black whale ; the great whale ; the true whale ; the right whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised .\n",
      "\n",
      "what then is the whale , which i include in the second species of my folios ?\n",
      "\n",
      "it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists ; the greenland whale of the english whalemen ; the baleine ordinaire of the french whalemen ; the growlands walfish of the swedes .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas ; it is the whale which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean , on the brazil banks , on the nor' west coast , and various other parts of the world , designated by them right whale cruising grounds .\n",
      "\n",
      "some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the americans .\n",
      "\n",
      "but they precisely agree in all their grand features ; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences , that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate .\n",
      "\n",
      "the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length , with reference to elucidating the sperm whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "a monster which , by the various names of fin , back , tall , spout , and long , john , has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the atlantic , in the new york packet , tracks .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the length he attains , and in his baleen , the fin , back resembles the right whale , but is of a less portly girth , and a lighter colour , approaching to olive .\n",
      "\n",
      "his great lips present a cable , like aspect , formed by the intertwisting , slanting folds of large wrinkles .\n",
      "\n",
      "his grand distinguishing feature , the fin , from which he derives his name , is often a conspicuous object .\n",
      "\n",
      "this fin is some three or four feet long , growing vertically from the hinder part of the back , of an angular shape , and with a very sharp pointed end .\n",
      "\n",
      "even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible , this isolated fin will , at times , be seen plainly projecting from the surface .\n",
      "\n",
      "when the sea is moderately calm , and slightly marked with spherical ripples , and this gnomon , like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface , it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial , with its style and wavy hour , lines graved on it .\n",
      "\n",
      "on that ahaz , dial the shadow often goes back .\n",
      "\n",
      "the fin , back is not gregarious .\n",
      "\n",
      "he seems a whale , hater , as some men are man , haters .\n",
      "\n",
      "very shy ; always going solitary ; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters ; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain ; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming , as to defy all present pursuit from man ; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race , bearing for his mark that style upon his back .\n",
      "\n",
      "from having the baleen in his mouth , the fin , back is sometimes included with the right whale , among a theoretic species denominated whalebone whales , that is , whales with baleen .\n",
      "\n",
      "of these so called whalebone whales , there would seem to be several varieties , most of which , however , are little known .\n",
      "\n",
      "broad , nosed whales and beaked whales ; pike , headed whales ; bunched whales ; under , jawed whales and rostrated whales , are the fishermen's names for a few sorts .\n",
      "\n",
      "in connection with this appellative of \" whalebone whales , \" it is of great importance to mention , that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales , yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan , founded upon either his baleen , or hump , or fin , or teeth ; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions , which the whale , in his kinds , presents .\n",
      "\n",
      "how then ?\n",
      "\n",
      "the baleen , hump , back , fin , and teeth ; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales , without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars .\n",
      "\n",
      "thus , the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale , each has a hump ; but there the similitude ceases .\n",
      "\n",
      "then , this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale , each of these has baleen ; but there again the similitude ceases .\n",
      "\n",
      "and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned .\n",
      "\n",
      "in various sorts of whales , they form such irregular combinations ; or , in the case of any one of them detached , such an irregular isolation ; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis .\n",
      "\n",
      "on this rock every one of the whale , naturalists has split .\n",
      "\n",
      "but it may possibly be conceived that , in the internal parts of the whale , in his anatomy—there , at least , we shall be able to hit the right classification .\n",
      "\n",
      "nay ; what thing , for example , is there in the greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen ?\n",
      "\n",
      "yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans , why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated .\n",
      "\n",

      "concerning the officers of the whale , craft , this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship , board , arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers , a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale , fleet .\n",
      "\n",
      "the large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced by the fact , that originally in the old dutch fishery , two centuries and more ago , the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain , but was divided between him and an officer called the specksnyder .\n",
      "\n",
      "literally this word means fat , cutter ; usage , however , in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer .\n",
      "\n",
      "in those days , the captain's authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel ; while over the whale , hunting department and all its concerns , the specksnyder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the british greenland fishery , under the corrupted title of specksioneer , this old dutch official is still retained , but his former dignity is sadly abridged .\n",
      "\n",
      "at present he ranks simply as senior harpooneer ; and as such , is but one of the captain's more inferior subalterns .\n",
      "\n",
      "nevertheless , as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends , and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat , but under certain circumstances ( night watches on a whaling ground ) the command of the ship's deck is also his ; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands , that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast , and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior ; though always , by them , familiarly regarded as their social equal .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea , is this—the first lives aft , the last forward .\n",
      "\n",
      "hence , in whale , ships and merchantmen alike , the mates have their quarters with the captain ; and so , too , in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship .\n",
      "\n",
      "that is to say , they take their meals in the captain's cabin , and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it .\n",
      "\n",
      "though the long period of a southern whaling voyage ( by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man ) , the peculiar perils of it , and the community of interest prevailing among a company , all of whom , high or low , depend for their profits , not upon fixed wages , but upon their common luck , together with their common vigilance , intrepidity , and hard work ; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally ; yet , never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may , in some primitive instances , live together ; for all that , the punctilious externals , at least , of the quarter , deck are seldom materially relaxed , and in no instance done away .\n",
      "\n",
      "indeed , many are the nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter , deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy ; nay , extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple , and not the shabbiest of pilot , cloth .\n",
      "\n",
      "and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption ; and though the only homage he ever exacted , was implicit , instantaneous obedience ; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter , deck ; and though there were times when , owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed , he addressed them in unusual terms , whether of condescension or in terrorem , or otherwise ; yet even captain ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor , perhaps , will it fail to be eventually perceived , that behind those forms and usages , as it were , he sometimes masked himself ; incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve .\n",
      "\n",
      "that certain sultanism of his brain , which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested ; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship .\n",
      "\n",
      "for be a man's intellectual superiority what it will , it can never assume the practical , available supremacy over other men , without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments , always , in themselves , more or less paltry and base .\n",
      "\n",
      "this it is , that for ever keeps god's true princes of the empire from the world's hustings ; and leaves the highest honors that this air can give , to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert , than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass .\n",
      "\n",
      "such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them , that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency .\n",
      "\n",
      "but when , as in the case of nicholas the czar , the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain ; then , the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor , will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing , ever forget a hint , incidentally so important in his art , as the one now alluded to .\n",
      "\n",
      "but ahab , my captain , still moves before me in all his nantucket grimness and shagginess ; and in this episode touching emperors and kings , i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whale , hunter like him ; and , therefore , all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me .\n",
      "\n",
      "oh , ahab !\n",
      "\n",
      "what shall be grand in thee , it must needs be plucked at from the skies , and dived for in the deep , and featured in the unbodied air !\n",
      "\n",
      "it is noon ; and dough , boy , the steward , thrusting his pale loaf , of , bread face from the cabin , scuttle , announces dinner to his lord and master ; who , sitting in the lee quarter , boat , has just been taking an observation of the sun ; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth , medallion , shaped tablet , reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg .\n",
      "\n",
      "from his complete inattention to the tidings , you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial .\n",
      "\n",
      "but presently , catching hold of the mizen shrouds , he swings himself to the deck , and in an even , unexhilarated voice , saying , \" dinner , mr. starbuck , \" disappears into the cabin .\n",
      "\n",
      "when the last echo of his sultan's step has died away , and starbuck , the first emir , has every reason to suppose that he is seated , then starbuck rouses from his quietude , takes a few turns along the planks , and , after a grave peep into the binnacle , says , with some touch of pleasantness , \" dinner , mr. stubb , \" and descends the scuttle .\n",
      "\n",
      "the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile , and then slightly shaking the main brace , to see whether it will be all right with that important rope , he likewise takes up the old burden , and with a rapid \" dinner , mr. flask , \" follows after his predecessors .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the third emir , now seeing himself all alone on the quarter , deck , seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint ; for , tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions , and kicking off his shoes , he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turk's head ; and then , by a dexterous sleight , pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf , he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck , reversing all other processions , by bringing up the rear with music .\n",
      "\n",
      "but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below , he pauses , ships a new face altogether , and , then , independent , hilarious little flask enters king ahab's presence , in the character of abjectus , or the slave .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea , usages , that while in the open air of the deck some officers will , upon provocation , bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander ; yet , ten to one , let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander's cabin , and straightway their inoffensive , not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him , as he sits at the head of the table ; this is marvellous , sometimes most comical .\n",
      "\n",
      "wherefore this difference ?\n",
      "\n",
      "a problem ?\n",
      "\n",
      "perhaps not .\n",
      "\n",
      "to have been belshazzar , king of babylon ; and to have been belshazzar , not haughtily but courteously , therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur .\n",
      "\n",
      "but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner , table of invited guests , that man's unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time ; that man's royalty of state transcends belshazzar's , for belshazzar was not the greatest .\n",
      "\n",
      "who has but once dined his friends , has tasted what it is to be cæsar .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship , master , then , by inference , you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea , life just mentioned .\n",
      "\n",
      "over his ivory , inlaid table , ahab presided like a mute , maned sea , lion on the white coral beach , surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs .\n",
      "\n",
      "in his own proper turn , each officer waited to be served .\n",
      "\n",
      "they were as little children before ahab ; and yet , in ahab , there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance .\n",
      "\n",
      "with one mind , their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man's knife , as he carved the chief dish before him .\n",
      "\n",
      "i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation , even upon so neutral a topic as the weather .\n",
      "\n",
      "no !\n",
      "\n",
      "and when reaching out his knife and fork , between which the slice of beef was locked , ahab thereby motioned starbuck's plate towards him , the mate received his meat as though receiving alms ; and cut it tenderly ; and a little started if , perchance , the knife grazed against the plate ; and chewed it noiselessly ; and swallowed it , not without circumspection .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , like the coronation banquet at frankfort , where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors , so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals , eaten in awful silence ; and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation ; only he himself was dumb .\n",
      "\n",
      "what a relief it was to choking stubb , when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below .\n",
      "\n",
      "and poor little flask , he was the youngest son , and little boy of this weary family party .\n",
      "\n",
      "his were the shinbones of the saline beef ; his would have been the drumsticks .\n",
      "\n",
      "for flask to have presumed to help himself , this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree .\n",
      "\n",
      "had he helped himself at that table , doubtless , never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world ; nevertheless , strange to say , ahab never forbade him .\n",
      "\n",
      "and had flask helped himself , the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it .\n",
      "\n",
      "least of all , did flask presume to help himself to butter .\n",
      "\n",
      "whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him , on account of its clotting his clear , sunny complexion ; or whether he deemed that , on so long a voyage in such marketless waters , butter was at a premium , and therefore was not for him , a subaltern ; however it was , flask , alas !\n",
      "\n",
      "was a butterless man !\n",
      "\n",
      "another thing .\n",

      "\n",
      "consider !\n",
      "\n",
      "for hereby flask's dinner was badly jammed in point of time .\n",
      "\n",
      "starbuck and stubb both had the start of him ; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear .\n",
      "\n",
      "if stubb even , who is but a peg higher than flask , happens to have but a small appetite , and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast , then flask must bestir himself , he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day ; for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck .\n",
      "\n",
      "therefore it was that flask once admitted in private , that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer , from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry , more or less .\n",
      "\n",
      "for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger , as keep it immortal in him .\n",
      "\n",
      "peace and satisfaction , thought flask , have for ever departed from my stomach .\n",

      "i am an officer ; but , how i wish i could fish a bit of old , fashioned beef in the forecastle , as i used to when i was before the mast .\n",
      "\n",
      "there's the fruits of promotion now ; there's the vanity of glory: there's the insanity of life !\n",
      "\n",
      "besides , if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask's official capacity , all that sailor had to do , in order to obtain ample vengeance , was to go aft at dinner , time , and get a peep at flask through the cabin sky , light , sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the pequod's cabin .\n",
      "\n",
      "after their departure , taking place in inverted order to their arrival , the canvas cloth was cleared , or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward .\n",
      "\n",
      "and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast , they being its residuary legatees .\n",
      "\n",
      "they made a sort of temporary servants' hall of the high and mighty cabin .\n",
      "\n",
      "in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain's table , was the entire care , free license and ease , the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers .\n",
      "\n",
      "while their masters , the mates , seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws , the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it .\n",
      "\n",
      "they dined like lords ; they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices .\n",
      "\n",
      "such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego , that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast , often the pale dough , boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt , junk , seemingly quarried out of the solid ox .\n",
      "\n",
      "and if he were not lively about it , if he did not go with a nimble hop , skip , and , jump , then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back , harpoon , wise .\n",
      "\n",
      "and once daggoo , seized with a sudden humor , assisted dough , boy's memory by snatching him up bodily , and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher , while tashtego , knife in hand , began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was naturally a very nervous , shuddering sort of little fellow , this bread , faced steward ; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse .\n",
      "\n",
      "and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab , and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages , dough , boy's whole life was one continual lip , quiver .\n",
      "\n",
      "commonly , after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded , he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining , and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door , till all was over .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego , opposing his filed teeth to the indian's: crosswise to them , daggoo seated on the floor , for a bench would have brought his hearse , plumed head to the low carlines ; at every motion of his colossal limbs , making the low cabin framework to shake , as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship .\n",
      "\n",
      "but for all this , the great negro was wonderfully abstemious , not to say dainty .\n",
      "\n",
      "it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad , baronial , and superb a person .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , doubtless , this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air ; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds .\n",
      "\n",
      "not by beef or by bread , are giants made or nourished .\n",
      "\n",
      "but queequeg , he had a mortal , barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so much so , that the trembling dough , boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms .\n",
      "\n",
      "and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself , that his bones might be picked , the simple , witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry , by his sudden fits of the palsy .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets , for their lances and other weapons ; and with which whetstones , at dinner , they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives ; that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough , boy .\n",
      "\n",
      "how could he forget that in his island days , queequeg , for one , must certainly have been guilty of some murderous , convivial indiscretions .\n",
      "\n",
      "alas !\n",
      "\n",
      "dough , boy !\n",
      "\n",
      "hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals .\n",
      "\n",
      "not a napkin should he carry on his arm , but a buckler .\n",
      "\n",
      "in good time , though , to his great delight , the three salt , sea warriors would rise and depart ; to his credulous , fable , mongering ears , all their martial bones jingling in them at every step , like moorish scimetars in scabbards .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , though these barbarians dined in the cabin , and nominally lived there ; still , being anything but sedentary in their habits , they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes , and just before sleeping , time , when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters .\n",
      "\n",
      "in this one matter , ahab seemed no exception to most american whale captains , who , as a set , rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship's cabin belongs to them ; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is , at any time , permitted there .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that , in real truth , the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it .\n",
      "\n",
      "for when they did enter it , it was something as a street , door enters a house ; turning inwards for a moment , only to be turned out the next ; and , as a permanent thing , residing in the open air .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor did they lose much hereby ; in the cabin was no companionship ; socially , ahab was inaccessible .\n",
      "\n",
      "though nominally included in the census of christendom , he was still an alien to it .\n",
      "\n",
      "he lived in the world , as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri .\n",
      "\n",
      "and as when spring and summer had departed , that wild logan of the woods , burying himself in the hollow of a tree , lived out the winter there , sucking his own paws ; so , in his inclement , howling old age , ahab's soul , shut up in the caved trunk of his body , there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom !\n",
      "\n",
      "it was during the more pleasant weather , that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast , head came round .\n",
      "\n",
      "in most american whalemen the mast , heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port ; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles , and more , to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground .\n",
      "\n",
      "and if , after a three , four , or five years' voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say , an empty vial even—then , her mast , heads are kept manned to the last ; and not till her skysail , poles sail in among the spires of the port , does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , as the business of standing mast , heads , ashore or afloat , is a very ancient and interesting one , let us in some measure expatiate here .\n",
      "\n",
      "i take it , that the earliest standers of mast , heads were the old egyptians ; because , in all my researches , i find none prior to them .\n",
      "\n",
      "for though their progenitors , the builders of babel , must doubtless , by their tower , have intended to rear the loftiest mast , head in all asia , or africa either ; yet ( ere the final truck was put to it ) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board , in the dread gale of god's wrath ; therefore , we cannot give these babel builders priority over the egyptians .\n",
      "\n",
      "and that the egyptians were a nation of mast , head standers , is an assertion based upon the general belief among archæologists , that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair , like formation of all four sides of those edifices ; whereby , with prodigious long upliftings of their legs , those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex , and sing out for new stars ; even as the look , outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail , or a whale just bearing in sight .\n",
      "\n",
      "in saint stylites , the famous christian hermit of old times , who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit , hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander , of , mast , heads ; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts , rain , hail , or sleet ; but valiantly facing everything out to the last , literally died at his post .\n",
      "\n",
      "of modern standers , of , mast , heads we have but a lifeless set ; mere stone , iron , and bronze men ; who , though well capable of facing out a stiff gale , are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight .\n",

      "there is napoleon ; who , upon the top of the column of vendome , stands with arms folded , some one hundred and fifty feet in the air ; careless , now , who rules the decks below ; whether louis philippe , louis blanc , or louis the devil .\n",
      "\n",
      "great washington , too , stands high aloft on his towering main , mast in baltimore , and like one of hercules' pillars , his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go .\n",

      "admiral nelson , also , on a capstan of gun , metal , stands his mast , head in trafalgar square ; and ever when most obscured by that london smoke , token is yet given that a hidden hero is there ; for where there is smoke , must be fire .\n",
      "\n",
      "but neither great washington , nor napoleon , nor nelson , will answer a single hail from below , however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze ; however it may be surmised , that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future , and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned .\n",
      "\n",
      "it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast , head standers of the land with those of the sea ; but that in truth it is not so , is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy , the sole historian of nantucket , stands accountable .\n",
      "\n",
      "the worthy obed tells us , that in the early times of the whale fishery , ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game , the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea , coast , to which the look , outs ascended by means of nailed cleats , something as fowls go upstairs in a hen , house .\n",
      "\n",
      "a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand , who , upon descrying the game , gave notice to the ready , manned boats nigh the beach .\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast , head ; nay , to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful .\n",
      "\n",
      "there you stand , a hundred feet above the silent decks , striding along the deep , as if the masts were gigantic stilts , while beneath you and between your legs , as it were , swim the hugest monsters of the sea , even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes .\n",
      "\n",
      "there you stand , lost in the infinite series of the sea , with nothing ruffled but the waves .\n",
      "\n",
      "the tranced ship indolently rolls ; the drowsy trade winds blow ; everything resolves you into languor .\n",
      "\n",
      "for the most part , in this tropic whaling life , a sublime uneventfulness invests you ; you hear no news ; read no gazettes ; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements ; you hear of no domestic afflictions ; bankrupt securities ; fall of stocks ; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks , and your bill of fare is immutable .\n",
      "\n",
      "in one of those southern whalesmen , on a long three or four years' voyage , as often happens , the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast , head would amount to several entire months .\n",
      "\n",
      "and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life , should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness , or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling , such as pertains to a bed , a hammock , a hearse , a sentry box , a pulpit , a coach , or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves .\n",
      "\n",
      "your most usual point of perch is the head of the t' gallant , mast , where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks ( almost peculiar to whalemen ) called the t' gallant cross , trees .\n",

      "\n",
      "to be sure , in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you , in the shape of a watch , coat ; but properly speaking the thickest watch , coat is no more of a house than the unclad body ; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle , and cannot freely move about in it , nor even move out of it , without running great risk of perishing ( like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter ) ; so a watch , coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope , or additional skin encasing you .\n",
      "\n",
      "you cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body , and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch , coat .\n",
      "\n",
      "concerning all this , it is much to be deplored that the mast , heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits , called crow's , nests , in which the look , outs of a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the fireside narrative of captain sleet , entitled \" a voyage among the icebergs , in quest of the greenland whale , and incidentally for the re , discovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland ; \" in this admirable volume , all standers of mast , heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow's , nest of the glacier , which was the name of captain sleet's good craft .\n",
      "\n",
      "he called it the sleet's crow's , nest , in honor of himself ; he being the original inventor and patentee , and free from all ridiculous false delicacy , and holding that if we call our own children after our own names ( we fathers being the original inventors and patentees ) , so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget .\n",
      "\n",
      "in shape , the sleet's crow's , nest is something like a large tierce or pipe ; it is open above , however , where it is furnished with a movable side , screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale .\n",
      "\n",
      "being fixed on the summit of the mast , you ascend into it through a little trap , hatch in the bottom .\n",
      "\n",
      "on the after side , or side next the stern of the ship , is a comfortable seat , with a locker underneath for umbrellas , comforters , and coats .\n",
      "\n",
      "in front is a leather rack , in which to keep your speaking trumpet , pipe , telescope , and other nautical conveniences .\n",
      "\n",
      "when captain sleet in person stood his mast , head in this crow's , nest of his , he tells us that he always had a rifle with him ( also fixed in the rack ) , together with a powder flask and shot , for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales , or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters ; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water , but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , it was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe , as he does , all the little detailed conveniences of his crow's , nest ; but though he so enlarges upon many of these , and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow's , nest , with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the \" local attraction \" of all binnacle magnets ; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's planks , and in the glacier's case , perhaps , to there having been so many broken , down blacksmiths among her crew ; i say , that though the captain is very discreet and scientific here , yet , for all his learned \" binnacle deviations , \" \" azimuth compass observations , \" and \" approximate errors , \" he knows very well , captain sleet , that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations , as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case , bottle , so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow's nest , within easy reach of his hand .\n",
      "\n",
      "though , upon the whole , i greatly admire and even love the brave , the honest , and learned captain ; yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case , bottle , seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been , while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest within three or four perches of the pole .\n",
      "\n",
      "but if we southern whale , fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as captain sleet and his greenlandmen were ; yet that disadvantage is greatly counter , balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float .\n",
      "\n",
      "for one , i used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely , resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg , or any one else off duty whom i might find there ; then ascending a little way further , and throwing a lazy leg over the top , sail yard , take a preliminary view of the watery pastures , and so at last mount to my ultimate destination .\n",
      "\n",
      "let me make a clean breast of it here , and frankly admit that i kept but sorry guard .\n",
      "\n",
      "with the problem of the universe revolving in me , how could i—being left completely to myself at such a thought , engendering altitude—how could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale , ships' standing orders , \" keep your weather eye open , and sing out every time . \"\n",
      "\n",

      "ten thousand blubber , hunters sweep over thee in vain . \"\n",
      "\n",

      "perhaps they were ; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon ; but lulled into such an opium , like listlessness of vacant , unconscious reverie is this absent , minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts , that at last he loses his identity ; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep , blue , bottomless soul , pervading mankind and nature ; and every strange , half , seen , gliding , beautiful thing that eludes him ; every dimly , discovered , uprising fin of some undiscernible form , seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it .\n",

      "for , owing to the large number of whale , cruisers ; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference , many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes , so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch , to encounter a single news , telling sail of any sort ; the inordinate length of each separate voyage ; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home ; all these , with other circumstances , direct and indirect , long obstructed the spread through the whole world , wide whaling , fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was hardly to be doubted , that several vessels reported to have encountered , at such or such a time , or on such or such a meridian , a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity , which whale , after doing great mischief to his assailants , had completely escaped them ; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption , i say , that the whale in question must have been no other than moby dick .\n",
      "\n",
      "yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity , cunning , and malice in the monster attacked ; therefore it was , that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick ; such hunters , perhaps , for the most part , were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred , more , as it were , to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large , than to the individual cause .\n",
      "\n",
      "in that way , mostly , the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded .\n",
      "\n",
      "and as for those who , previously hearing of the white whale , by chance caught sight of him ; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them , almost , as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him , as for any other whale of that species .\n",
      "\n",
      "but at length , such calamities did ensue in these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles , broken limbs , or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of fatality ; those repeated disastrous repulses , all accumulating and piling their terrors upon moby dick ; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters , to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate , and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters .\n",
      "\n",
      "for not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events , —as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi ; but , in maritime life , far more than in that of terra firma , wild rumors abound , wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to .\n",
      "\n",
      "and as the sea surpasses the land in this matter , so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life , in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there .\n",
      "\n",
      "for not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors ; but of all sailors , they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea ; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels , but , hand to jaw , give battle to them .\n",
      "\n",
      "alone , in such remotest waters , that though you sailed a thousand miles , and passed a thousand shores , you would not come to any chiseled hearth , stone , or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun ; in such latitudes and longitudes , pursuing too such a calling as he does , the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth .\n",
      "\n",
      "no wonder , then , that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces , the outblown rumors of the white whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints , and half , formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies , which eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike , that few who by those rumors , at least , had heard of the white whale , few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw .\n",
      "\n",
      "but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work .\n",
      "\n",
      "not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm whale , as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan , died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body .\n",
      "\n",
      "there are those this day among them , who , though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale , would perhaps—either from professional inexperience , or incompetency , or timidity , decline a contest with the sperm whale ; at any rate , there are plenty of whalemen , especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the american flag , who have never hostilely encountered the sperm whale , but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north ; seated on their hatches , these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe , to the wild , strange tales of southern whaling .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor is the pre , eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended , than on board of those prows which stem him .\n",
      "\n",
      "and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it ; we find some book naturalists—olassen and povelson—declaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea , but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor even down to so late a time as cuvier's , were these or almost similar impressions effaced .\n",
      "\n",
      "for in his natural history , the baron himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale , all fish ( sharks included ) are \" struck with the most lively terrors , \" and \" often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "and however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these ; yet in their full terribleness , even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson , the superstitious belief in them is , in some vicissitudes of their vocation , revived in the minds of the hunters .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him , not a few of the fishermen recalled , in reference to moby dick , the earlier days of the sperm whale fishery , when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare ; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued , yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was not for mortal man .\n",
      "\n",
      "that to attempt it , would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity .\n",
      "\n",
      "on this head , there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted .\n",
      "\n",
      "nevertheless , some there were , who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to moby dick ; and a still greater number who , chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely , without the specific details of any certain calamity , and without superstitious accompaniments , were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered .\n",
      "\n",
      "one of the wild suggestions referred to , as at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined , was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous ; that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor , credulous as such minds must have been , was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability .\n",
      "\n",
      "for as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged , even to the most erudite research ; so the hidden ways of the sperm whale when beneath the surface remain , in great part , unaccountable to his pursuers ; and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them , especially concerning the mystic modes whereby , after sounding to a great depth , he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is a thing well known to both american and english whale , ships , and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby , that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific , in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland seas .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor is it to be gainsaid , that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days .\n",
      "\n",
      "hence , by inference , it has been believed by some whalemen , that the nor' west passage , so long a problem to man , was never a problem to the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that here , in the real living experience of living men , the prodigies related in old times of the inland strello mountain in portugal ( near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface ) ; and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse ( whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage ) ; these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen .\n",
      "\n",
      "forced into familiarity , then , with such prodigies as these ; and knowing that after repeated , intrepid assaults , the white whale had escaped alive ; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions ; declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous , but immortal ( for immortality is but ubiquity in time ) ; that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks , he would still swim away unharmed ; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood , such a sight would be but a ghastly deception ; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away , his unsullied jet would once more be seen .\n",
      "\n",
      "but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings , there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales , but , as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow , white wrinkled forehead , and a high , pyramidical white hump .\n",
      "\n",
      "these were his prominent features ; the tokens whereby , even in the limitless , uncharted seas , he revealed his identity , at a long distance , to those who knew him .\n",
      "\n",
      "the rest of his body was so streaked , and spotted , and marbled with the same shrouded hue , that , in the end , he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale ; a name , indeed , literally justified by his vivid aspect , when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea , leaving a milky , way wake of creamy foam , all spangled with golden gleamings .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor was it his unwonted magnitude , nor his remarkable hue , nor yet his deformed lower jaw , that so much invested the whale with natural terror , as that unexampled , intelligent malignity which , according to specific accounts , he had over and over again evinced in his assaults .\n",
      "\n",
      "more than all , his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , when swimming before his exulting pursuers , with every apparent symptom of alarm , he had several times been known to turn round suddenly , and , bearing down upon them , either stave their boats to splinters , or drive them back in consternation to their ship .\n",
      "\n",
      "already several fatalities had attended his chase .\n",
      "\n",
      "but though similar disasters , however little bruited ashore , were by no means unusual in the fishery ; yet , in most instances , such seemed the white whale's infernal aforethought of ferocity , that every dismembering or death that he caused , was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent .\n",
      "\n",
      "judge , then , to what pitches of inflamed , distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled , when amid the chips of chewed boats , and the sinking limbs of torn comrades , they swam out of the white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene , exasperating sunlight , that smiled on , as if at a birth or a bridal .\n",
      "\n",
      "his three boats stove around him , and oars and men both whirling in the eddies ; one captain , seizing the line , knife from his broken prow , had dashed at the whale , as an arkansas duellist at his foe , blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom , deep life of the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "that captain was ahab .\n",
      "\n",
      "and then it was , that suddenly sweeping his sickle , shaped lower jaw beneath him , moby dick had reaped away ahab's leg , as a mower a blade of grass in the field .\n",
      "\n",
      "no turbaned turk , no hired venetian or malay , could have smote him with more seeming malice .\n",
      "\n",
      "small reason was there to doubt , then , that ever since that almost fatal encounter , ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him , not only all his bodily woes , but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations .\n",
      "\n",
      "the white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them , till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung .\n",
      "\n",
      "that intangible malignity which has been from the beginning ; to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe one , half of the worlds ; which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil ; —ahab did not fall down and worship it like them ; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale , he pitted himself , all mutilated , against it .\n",
      "\n",
      "all that most maddens and torments ; all that stirs up the lees of things ; all truth with malice in it ; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain ; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought ; all evil , to crazy ahab , were visibly personified , and made practically assailable in moby dick .\n",
      "\n",
      "he piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down ; and then , as if his chest had been a mortar , he burst his hot heart's shell upon it .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment .\n",
      "\n",
      "then , in darting at the monster , knife in hand , he had but given loose to a sudden , passionate , corporal animosity ; and when he received the stroke that tore him , he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration , but nothing more .\n",
      "\n",
      "yet , when by this collision forced to turn towards home , and for long months of days and weeks , ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock , rounding in mid winter that dreary , howling patagonian cape ; then it was , that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another ; and so interfusing , made him mad .\n",
      "\n",
      "that it was only then , on the homeward voyage , after the encounter , that the final monomania seized him , seems all but certain from the fact that , at intervals during the passage , he was a raving lunatic ; and , though unlimbed of a leg , yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest , and was moreover intensified by his delirium , that his mates were forced to lace him fast , even there , as he sailed , raving in his hammock .\n",
      "\n",
      "in a strait , jacket , he swung to the mad rockings of the gales .\n",
      "\n",
      "and , when running into more sufferable latitudes , the ship , with mild stun'sails spread , floated across the tranquil tropics , and , to all appearances , the old man's delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn swells , and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air ; even then , when he bore that firm , collected front , however pale , and issued his calm orders once again ; and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone ; even then , ahab , in his hidden self , raved on .\n",
      "\n",
      "human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "when you think it fled , it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form .\n",
      "\n",
      "ahab's full lunacy subsided not , but deepeningly contracted ; like the unabated hudson , when that noble northman flows narrowly , but unfathomably through the highland gorge .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , as in his narrow , flowing monomania , not one jot of ahab's broad madness had been left behind ; so in that broad madness , not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished .\n",
      "\n",
      "that before living agent , now became the living instrument .\n",
      "\n",
      "if such a furious trope may stand , his special lunacy stormed his general sanity , and carried it , and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark ; so that far from having lost his strength , ahab , to that one end , did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object .\n",
      "\n",
      "this is much ; yet ahab's larger , darker , deeper part remains unhinted .\n",

      "had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew , you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom , and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts , spread them before him on his screwed , down table .\n",

      "\n",
      "so assured , indeed , is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale's resorting to given waters , that many hunters believe that , could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world ; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated , then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring , shoals or the flights of swallows .\n",

      "besides , when making a passage from one feeding , ground to another , the sperm whales , guided by some infallible instinct—say , rather , secret intelligence from the deity—mostly swim in veins , as they are called ; continuing their way along a given ocean , line with such undeviating exactitude , that no ship ever sailed her course , by any chart , with one tithe of such marvellous precision .\n",
      "\n",
      "though , in these cases , the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor's parallel , and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable , straight wake , yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is said to swim , generally embraces some few miles in width ( more or less , as the vein is presumed to expand or contract ) ; but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale , ship's mast , heads , when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone .\n",
      "\n",
      "the sum is , that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path , migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for .\n",

      "there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme .\n",

      "there it was , too , that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place ; there the waves were storied with his deeds ; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance .\n",
      "\n",
      "but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt , he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned , however flattering it might be to those hopes ; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest .\n",

      "yet the premature hour of the pequod's sailing had , perhaps , been correctly selected by ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things .\n",
      "\n",
      "because , an interval of three hundred and sixty , five days and nights was before him ; an interval which , instead of impatiently enduring ashore , he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt ; if by chance the white whale , spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding , grounds , should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian gulf , or in the bengal bay , or china seas , or in any other waters haunted by his race .\n",

      "so that monsoons , pampas , nor' , westers , harmattans , trades ; any wind but the levanter and simoon , might blow moby dick into the devious zig , zag world , circle of the pequod's circumnavigating wake .\n",
      "\n",
      "but granting all this ; yet , regarded discreetly and coolly , seems it not but a mad idea , this ; that in the broad boundless ocean , one solitary whale , even if encountered , should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter , even as a white , bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople ?\n",
      "\n",
      "yes .\n",
      "\n",
      "for the peculiar snow , white brow of moby dick , and his snow , white hump , could not but be unmistakable .\n",

      "yet these , perhaps , instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness , or fright at his own resolve , were but the plainest tokens of its intensity .\n",

      "\n",
      "the latter was the eternal , living principle or soul in him ; and in sleep , being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind , which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent , it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing , of which , for the time , it was no longer an integral .\n",
      "\n",
      "but as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul , therefore it must have been that , in ahab's case , yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose ; that purpose , by its own sheer inveteracy of will , forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self , assumed , independent being of its own .\n",

      "so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book ; and , indeed , as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales , the foregoing chapter , in its earlier part , is as important a one as will be found in this volume ; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon , in order to be adequately understood , and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds , as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair .\n",

      "first: i have personally known three instances where a whale , after receiving a harpoon , has effected a complete escape ; and , after an interval ( in one instance of three years ) , has been again struck by the same hand , and slain ; when the two irons , both marked by the same private cypher , have been taken from the body .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons ; and i think it may have been something more than that ; the man who darted them happening , in the interval , to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa , went ashore there , joined a discovery party , and penetrated far into the interior , where he travelled for a period of nearly two years , often endangered by serpents , savages , tigers , poisonous miasmas , with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions .\n",
      "\n",
      "meanwhile , the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels ; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe , brushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa ; but to no purpose .\n",

      "this man and this whale again came together , and the one vanquished the other .\n",
      "\n",
      "i say i , myself , have known three instances similar to this ; that is in two of them i saw the whales struck ; and , upon the second attack , saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them , afterwards taken from the dead fish .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the three , year instance , it so fell out that i was in the boat both times , first and last , and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye , which i had observed there three years previous .\n",

      "\n",
      "why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales ; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be , they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him , and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil .\n",
      "\n",
      "no: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini , insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea , without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance .\n",

      "first: in the year 1820 the ship essex , captain pollard , of nantucket , was cruising in the pacific ocean .\n",

      "\n",
      "thirdly: some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j—— , then commanding an american sloop , of , war of the first class , happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains , on board a nantucket ship in the harbor of oahu , sandwich islands .\n",

      "\n",
      "an uncommon large whale , the body of which was larger than the ship itself , lay almost at the surface of the water , but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship , which was in full sail , was almost upon him , so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him .\n",
      "\n",
      "we were thus placed in the most imminent danger , as this gigantic creature , setting up its back , raised the ship three feet at least out of the water .\n",
      "\n",
      "the masts reeled , and the sails fell altogether , while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck , concluding that we had struck upon some rock ; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity .\n",

      "he substantiates every word .\n",

      "the ship , however , was by no means a large one: a russian craft built on the siberian coast , and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home .\n",
      "\n",
      "in that up and down manly book of old , fashioned adventure , so full , too , of honest wonders—the voyage of lionel wafer , one of ancient dampier's old chums—i found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from langsdorff , that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example , if such be needed .\n",

      "\n",
      "and , indeed , the shock was so sudden and violent , that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock ; but when the amazement was a little over , we cast the lead , and sounded , but found no ground .\n",
      "\n",
      "* * * * * the suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages , and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks .\n",
      "\n",
      "captain davis , who lay with his head on a gun , was thrown out of his cabin ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake , and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake , somewhere about that time , did actually do great mischief along the spanish land .\n",
      "\n",
      "but i should not much wonder if , in the darkness of that early hour of the morning , the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath .\n",
      "\n",
      "i might proceed with several more examples , one way or another known to me , of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "in more than one instance , he has been known , not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships , but to pursue the ship itself , and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks .\n",
      "\n",
      "the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head ; and , as for his strength , let me say , that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have , in a calm , been transferred to the ship , and secured there ; the whale towing her great hull through the water , as a horse walks off with a cart .\n",
      "\n",
      "again , it is very often observed that , if the sperm whale , once struck , is allowed time to rally , he then acts , not so often with blind rage , as with wilful , deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers ; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character , that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth , and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes .\n",
      "\n",
      "but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration ; a remarkable and most significant one , by which you will not fail to see , that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day , but that these marvels ( like all marvels ) are mere repetitions of the ages ; so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon—verily there is nothing new under the sun .\n",

      "in the sixth christian century lived procopius , a christian magistrate of constantinople , in the days when justinian was emperor and belisarius general .\n",

      "as many know , he wrote the history of his own times , a work every way of uncommon value .\n",

      "by the best authorities , he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian , except in some one or two particulars , not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , in this history of his , procopius mentions that , during the term of his prefecture at constantinople , a great sea , monster was captured in the neighboring propontis , or sea of marmora , after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years .\n",

      "\n",
      "and i will tell you why .\n",
      "\n",
      "for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it .\n",
      "\n",
      "even now i am certain that those seas are not , and perhaps never can be , in the present constitution of things , a place for his habitual gregarious resort .\n",
      "\n",
      "but further investigations have recently proved to me , that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the mediterranean .\n",
      "\n",
      "i am told , on good authority , that on the barbary coast , a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , as a vessel of war readily passes through the dardanelles , hence a sperm whale could , by the same route , pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the propontis , as far as i can learn , none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found , the aliment of the right whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale—squid or cuttle , fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea , because large creatures , but by no means the largest of that sort , have been found at its surface .\n",
      "\n",
      "if , then , you properly put these statements together , and reason upon them a bit , you will clearly perceive that , according to all human reasoning , procopius's sea , monster , that for half a century stove the ships of a roman emperor , must in all probability have been a sperm whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "though , consumed with the hot fire of his purpose , ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick ; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion ; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways , altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage .\n",
      "\n",
      "or at least if this were otherwise , there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him .\n",
      "\n",
      "it would be refining too much , perhaps , even considering his monomania , to hint that his vindictiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales , and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted .\n",
      "\n",
      "but if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable , there were still additional considerations which , though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion , yet were by no means incapable of swaying him .\n",
      "\n",
      "to accomplish his object ahab must use tools ; and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon , men are most apt to get out of order .\n",
      "\n",
      "he knew , for example , that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over starbuck , yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership ; for to the purely spiritual , the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation .\n",
      "\n",
      "starbuck's body and starbuck's coerced will were ahab's , so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbuck's brain ; still he knew that for all this the chief mate , in his soul , abhorred his captain's quest , and could he , would joyfully disintegrate himself from it , or even frustrate it .\n",
      "\n",
      "it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale was seen .\n",
      "\n",
      "during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain's leadership , unless some ordinary , prudential , circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him .\n",
      "\n",
      "not only that , but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that , for the present , the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it ; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background ( for few men's courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action ) ; that when they stood their long night watches , his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than moby dick .\n",
      "\n",
      "for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest ; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer weather , and they inhale its fickleness—and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit , however promissory of life and passion in the end , it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor was ahab unmindful of another thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "in times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations ; but such times are evanescent .\n",
      "\n",
      "the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man , thought ahab , is sordidness .\n",
      "\n",
      "granting that the white whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew , and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight , errantism in them , still , while for the love of it they give chase to moby dick , they must also have food for their more common , daily appetites .\n",
      "\n",
      "for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre , without committing burglaries , picking pockets , and gaining other pious perquisites by the way .\n",
      "\n",
      "had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object—that final and romantic object , too many would have turned from in disgust .\n",
      "\n",
      "i will not strip these men , thought ahab , of all hopes of cash—aye , cash .\n",
      "\n",
      "they may scorn cash now ; but let some months go by , and no perspective promise of it to them , and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them , this same cash would soon cashier ahab .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally .\n",
      "\n",
      "having impulsively , it is probable , and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequod's voyage , ahab was now entirely conscious that , in so doing , he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation ; and with perfect impunity , both moral and legal , his crew if so disposed , and to that end competent , could refuse all further obedience to him , and even violently wrest from him the command .\n",
      "\n",
      "from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation , and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground , ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "that protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand , backed by a heedful , closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to .\n",
      "\n",
      "for all these reasons then , and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here , ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural , nominal purpose of the pequod's voyage ; observe all customary usages ; and not only that , but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession .\n",
      "\n",
      "be all this as it may , his voice was now often heard hailing the three mast , heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look , out , and not omit reporting even a porpoise .\n",
      "\n",
      "this vigilance was not long without reward .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a cloudy , sultry afternoon ; the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks , or vacantly gazing over into the lead , coloured waters .\n",

      "\n",
      "i was the attendant or page of queequeg , while busy at the mat .\n",
      "\n",
      "as i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp , using my own hand for the shuttle , and as queequeg , standing sideways , ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads , and idly looking off upon the water , carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea , only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword , that it seemed as if this were the loom of time , and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fates .\n",
      "\n",
      "there lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single , ever returning , unchanging vibration , and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own .\n",
      "\n",
      "this warp seemed necessity ; and here , thought i , with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads .\n",
      "\n",
      "meantime , queequeg's impulsive , indifferent sword , sometimes hitting the woof slantingly , or crookedly , or strongly , or weakly , as the case might be ; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric ; this savage's sword , thought i , which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof ; this easy , indifferent sword must be chance—aye , chance , free will , and necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working together .\n",
      "\n",
      "the straight warp of necessity , not to be swerved from its ultimate course—its every alternating vibration , indeed , only tending to that ; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads ; and chance , though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity , and sideways in its motions directed by free will , though thus prescribed to by both , chance by turns rules either , and has the last featuring blow at events .\n",
      "\n",
      "thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange , long drawn , and musically wild and unearthly , that the ball of free will dropped from my hand , and i stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing .\n",

      "such , gentlemen , is the inflexibility of sea , usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces .\n",

      "besides , it was the stronger men in the town , ho that had been divided into gangs , taking turns at the pumps ; and being the most athletic seaman of them all , steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs ; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties , such being the case with his comrades .\n",
      "\n",
      "i mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men .\n",

      "\n",
      "any man who has gone sailor in a whale , ship will understand this ; and all this and doubtless much more , the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command .\n",
      "\n",
      "but as he sat still for a moment , and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder , casks heaped up in him and the slow , match silently burning along towards them ; as he instinctively saw all this , that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being—a repugnance most felt , when felt at all , by really valiant men even when aggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling , gentlemen , stole over steelkilt .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" therefore , in his ordinary tone , only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in , he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business , and he would not do it .\n",
      "\n",
      "and then , without at all alluding to the shovel , he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers ; who , not being billeted at the pumps , had done little or nothing all day .\n",
      "\n",
      "to this , radney replied with an oath , in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command ; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman , with an uplifted cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by .\n",

      "in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale , where all manner of spouts , jets d'eau , hot springs and cold , saratoga and baden , baden , come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain .\n",

      "in the title , page of the original edition of the \" advancement of learning \" you will find some curious whales .\n",
      "\n",
      "but quitting all these unprofessional attempts , let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober , scientific delineations , by those who know .\n",
      "\n",
      "in old harris's collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages , a . d . 1671 , entitled \" a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale , peter peterson of friesland , master . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "in one of those plates the whales , like great rafts of logs , are represented lying among ice , isles , with white bears running over their living backs .\n",
      "\n",
      "in another plate , the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes .\n",
      "\n",
      "then again , there is an imposing quarto , written by one captain colnett , a post captain in the english navy , entitled \" a voyage round cape horn into the south seas , for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fisheries . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "in this book is an outline purporting to be a \" picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale , drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico , august , 1793 , and hoisted on deck . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines .\n",
      "\n",
      "to mention but one thing about it , let me say that it has an eye which applied , according to the accompanying scale , to a full grown sperm whale , would make the eye of that whale a bow , window some five feet long .\n",
      "\n",
      "ah , my gallant captain , why did ye not give us jonah looking out of that eye !\n",
      "\n",
      "nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender , free from the same heinousness of mistake .\n",
      "\n",
      "look at that popular work \" goldsmith's animated nature . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "in the abridged london edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged \" whale \" and a \" narwhale . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "i do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys .\n",
      "\n",
      "then , again , in 1825 , bernard germain , count de lacépède , a great naturalist , published a scientific systemized whale book , wherein are several pictures of the different species of the leviathan .\n",
      "\n",
      "all these are not only incorrect , but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale ( that is to say , the right whale ) , even scoresby , a long experienced man as touching that species , declares not to have its counterpart in nature .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the placing of the cap , sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier , brother to the famous baron .\n",
      "\n",
      "in 1836 , he published a natural history of whales , in which he gives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "before showing that picture to any nantucketer , you had best provide for your summary retreat from nantucket .\n",
      "\n",
      "in a word , frederick cuvier's sperm whale is not a sperm whale , but a squash .\n",
      "\n",
      "of course , he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage ( such men seldom have ) , but whence he derived that picture , who can tell ?\n",
      "\n",
      "perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field , desmarest , got one of his authentic abortions ; that is , from a chinese drawing .\n",
      "\n",
      "and what sort of lively lads with the pencil those chinese are , many queer cups and saucers inform us .\n",
      "\n",
      "as for the sign , painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil , dealers , what shall be said of them ?\n",
      "\n",
      "they are generally richard iii .\n",
      "\n",
      "whales , with dromedary humps , and very savage ; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts , that is whaleboats full of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint .\n",
      "\n",
      "but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all .\n",
      "\n",
      "consider !\n",
      "\n",
      "most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars .\n",
      "\n",
      "though elephants have stood for their full , lengths , the living leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait .\n",
      "\n",
      "the living whale , in his full majesty and significance , is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters ; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight , like a launched line , of , battle ship ; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air , so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations .\n",
      "\n",
      "and , not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full , grown platonian leviathan ; yet , even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck , such is then the outlandish , eel , like , limbered , varying shape of him , that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch .\n",
      "\n",
      "but it may be fancied , that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale , accurate hints may be derived touching his true form .\n",
      "\n",
      "not at all .\n",
      "\n",
      "for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan , that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape .\n",
      "\n",
      "though jeremy bentham's skeleton , which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors , correctly conveys the idea of a burly , browed utilitarian old gentleman , with all jeremy's other leading personal characteristics ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's articulated bones .\n",
      "\n",
      "in fact , as the great hunter says , the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it .\n",
      "\n",
      "this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head , as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is also very curiously displayed in the side fin , the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand , minus only the thumb .\n",
      "\n",
      "this fin has four regular bone , fingers , the index , middle , ring , and little finger .\n",
      "\n",
      "but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering , as the human fingers in an artificial covering .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" however recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us , \" said humorous stubb one day , \" he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "for all these reasons , then , any way you may look at it , you must needs conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last .\n",
      "\n",
      "true , one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness .\n",
      "\n",
      "so there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like .\n",
      "\n",
      "and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour , is by going a whaling yourself ; but by so doing , you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him .\n",
      "\n",
      "wherefore , it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan .\n",
      "\n",
      "pictures of whaling scenes .\n",
      "\n",
      "in connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales , i am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books , both ancient and modern , especially in pliny , purchas , hackluyt , harris , cuvier , etc .\n",
      "\n",
      "but i pass that matter by .\n",
      "\n",
      "i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale ; colnett's , huggins's , frederick cuvier's , and beale's .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the previous chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to .\n",
      "\n",
      "huggins's is far better than theirs ; but , by great odds , beale's is the best .\n",
      "\n",
      "all beale's drawings of this whale are good , excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes , capping his second chapter .\n",
      "\n",
      "his frontispiece , boats attacking sperm whales , though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men , is admirably correct and life , like in its general effect .\n",
      "\n",
      "some of the sperm whale drawings in j . ross browne are pretty correct in contour ; but they are wretchedly engraved .\n",
      "\n",
      "that is not his fault though .\n",
      "\n",
      "of the right whale , the best outline pictures are in scoresby ; but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression .\n",
      "\n",
      "he has but one picture of whaling scenes , and this is a sad deficiency , because it is by such pictures only , when at all well done , that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , taken for all in all , by far the finest , though in some details not the most correct , presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found , are two large french engravings , well executed , and taken from paintings by one garnery .\n",
      "\n",
      "respectively , they represent attacks on the sperm and right whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the first engraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might , just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean , and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks .\n",
      "\n",
      "the prow of the boat is partially unbroken , and is drawn just balancing upon the monster's spine ; and standing in that prow , for that one single incomputable flash of time , you behold an oarsman , half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale , and in the act of leaping , as if from a precipice .\n",
      "\n",
      "the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true .\n",
      "\n",
      "the half , emptied line , tub floats on the whitened sea ; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it ; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright ; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene .\n",
      "\n",
      "serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale , but let that pass ; since , for the life of me , i could not draw so good a one .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the second engraving , the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale , that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock , slide from the patagonian cliffs .\n",
      "\n",
      "his jets are erect , full , and black like soot ; so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney , you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below .\n",
      "\n",
      "sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs , shell , fish , and other sea candies and maccaroni , which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back .\n",
      "\n",
      "and all the while the thick , lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep , leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake , and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle , wheels of an ocean steamer .\n",
      "\n",
      "thus , the foreground is all raging commotion ; but behind , in admirable artistic contrast , is the glassy level of a sea becalmed , the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship , and the inert mass of a dead whale , a conquered fortress , with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale , pole inserted into his spout , hole .\n",
      "\n",
      "who garnery the painter is , or was , i know not .\n",
      "\n",
      "but my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject , or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman .\n",
      "\n",
      "the french are the lads for painting action .\n",
      "\n",
      "go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe , and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas , as in that triumphal hall at versailles ; where the beholder fights his way , pell , mell , through the consecutive great battles of france ; where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights , and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by , like a charge of crowned centaurs ?\n",
      "\n",
      "not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery , are these sea battle , pieces of garnery .\n",
      "\n",
      "the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes .\n",
      "\n",
      "with not one tenth of england's experience in the fishery , and not the thousandth part of that of the americans , they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt .\n",
      "\n",
      "for the most part , the english and american whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things , such as the vacant profile of the whale ; which , so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned , is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid .\n",
      "\n",
      "even scoresby , the justly renowned right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland whale , and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises , treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks , chopping knives , and grapnels ; and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety , six fac , similes of magnified arctic snow crystals .\n",
      "\n",
      "i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager ( i honor him for a veteran ) , but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace .\n",
      "\n",
      "in addition to those fine engravings from garnery , there are two other french engravings worthy of note , by some one who subscribes himself \" h . durand . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "one of them , though not precisely adapted to our present purpose , nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is a quiet noon , scene among the isles of the pacific ; a french whaler anchored , inshore , in a calm , and lazily taking water on board ; the loosened sails of the ship , and the long leaves of the palms in the background , both drooping together in the breezeless air .\n",
      "\n",
      "the effect is very fine , when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose .\n",
      "\n",
      "the other engraving is quite a different affair: the ship hove , to upon the open sea , and in the very heart of the leviathanic life , with a right whale alongside ; the vessel ( in the act of cutting , in ) hove over to the monster as if to a quay ; and a boat , hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity , is about giving chase to whales in the distance .\n",
      "\n",
      "the harpoons and lances lie levelled for use ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; while from a sudden roll of the sea , the little craft stands half , erect out of the water , like a rearing horse .\n",
      "\n",
      "from the ship , the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies ; and to windward , a black cloud , rising up with earnest of squalls and rains , seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen .\n",
      "\n",
      "stone ; in mountains ; in stars .\n",
      "\n",
      "on tower , hill , as you go down to the london docks , you may have seen a crippled beggar ( or kedger , as the sailors say ) holding a painted board before him , representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg .\n",
      "\n",
      "there are three whales and three boats ; and one of the boats ( presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity ) is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "any time these ten years , they tell me , has that man held up that picture , and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the time of his justification has now come .\n",
      "\n",
      "his three whales are as good whales as were ever published in wapping , at any rate ; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , though for ever mounted on that stump , never a stump , speech does the poor whaleman make ; but , with downcast eyes , stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation .\n",
      "\n",
      "throughout the pacific , and also in nantucket , and new bedford , and sag harbor , you will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling , scenes , graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm whale , teeth , or ladies' busks wrought out of the right whale , bone , and other like skrimshander articles , as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material , in their hours of ocean leisure .\n",
      "\n",
      "some of them have little boxes of dentistical , looking implements , specially intended for the skrimshandering business .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , in general , they toil with their jack , knives alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner's fancy .\n",

      "\n",
      "a vast pulpy mass , furlongs in length and breadth , of a glancing cream , colour , lay floating on the water , innumerable long arms radiating from its centre , and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas , as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach .\n",
      "\n",
      "no perceptible face or front did it have ; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct ; but undulated there on the billows , an unearthly , formless , chance , like apparition of life .\n",

      "\n",
      "so rarely is it beheld , that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean , yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form ; notwithstanding , they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food .\n",
      "\n",
      "for though other species of whales find their food above water , and may be seen by man in the act of feeding , the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface ; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what , precisely , that food consists .\n",
      "\n",
      "at times , when closely pursued , he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid ; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length .\n",
      "\n",
      "they fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean ; and that the sperm whale , unlike other species , is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it .\n",
      "\n",
      "there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid .\n",
      "\n",
      "the manner in which the bishop describes it , as alternately rising and sinking , with some other particulars he narrates , in all this the two correspond .\n",
      "\n",
      "but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it .\n",
      "\n",
      "by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature , here spoken of , it is included among the class of cuttle , fish , to which , indeed , in certain external respects it would seem to belong , but only as the anak of the tribe .\n",
      "\n",
      "with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described , as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented , i have here to speak of the magical , sometimes horrible whale , line .\n",
      "\n",
      "the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp , slightly vapored with tar , not impregnated with it , as in the case of ordinary ropes ; for while tar , as ordinarily used , makes the hemp more pliable to the rope , maker , and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use ; yet , not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale , line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as most seamen are beginning to learn , tar in general by no means adds to the rope's durability or strength , however much it may give it compactness and gloss .\n",
      "\n",
      "of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale , lines ; for , though not so durable as hemp , it is stronger , and far more soft and elastic ; and i will add ( since there is an æsthetics in all things ) , is much more handsome and becoming to the boat , than hemp .\n",
      "\n",
      "hemp is a dusky , dark fellow , a sort of indian ; but manilla is as a golden , haired circassian to behold .\n",
      "\n",
      "the whale , line is only two , thirds of an inch in thickness .\n",
      "\n",
      "at first sight , you would not think it so strong as it really is .\n",
      "\n",
      "by experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds ; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons .\n",
      "\n",
      "in length , the common sperm whale , line measures something over two hundred fathoms .\n",
      "\n",
      "towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub , not like the worm , pipe of a still though , but so as to form one round , cheese , shaped mass of densely bedded \" sheaves , \" or layers of concentric spiralizations , without any hollow but the \" heart , \" or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese .\n",
      "\n",
      "as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would , in running out , infallibly take somebody's arm , leg , or entire body off , the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub .\n",
      "\n",
      "some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business , carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub , so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one ; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs .\n",
      "\n",
      "there is some advantage in this ; because these twin , tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat , and do not strain it so much ; whereas , the american tub , nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth , makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half , inch in thickness ; for the bottom of the whale , boat is like critical ice , which will bear up a considerable distributed weight , but not very much of a concentrated one .\n",
      "\n",
      "when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american line , tub , the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding , cake to present to the whales .\n",
      "\n",
      "both ends of the line are exposed ; the lower end terminating in an eye , splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub , and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything .\n",
      "\n",
      "this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts .\n",
      "\n",
      "first: in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat , in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon .\n",
      "\n",
      "in these instances , the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale , as it were , from the one boat to the other ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort .\n",
      "\n",
      "second: this arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake ; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat , and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single , smoking minute as he sometimes does , he would not stop there , for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea ; and in that case no town , crier would ever find her again .\n",
      "\n",
      "before lowering the boat for the chase , the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub , and passing round the loggerhead there , is again carried forward the entire length of the boat , resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man's oar , so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing ; and also passing between the men , as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales , to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat , where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill , prevents it from slipping out .\n",
      "\n",
      "from the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows , and is then passed inside the boat again ; and some ten or twenty fathoms ( called box , line ) being coiled upon the box in the bows , it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft , and is then attached to the short , warp—the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon ; but previous to that connexion , the short , warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail .\n",
      "\n",
      "thus the whale , line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils , twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction .\n",
      "\n",
      "all the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions ; so that to the timid eye of the landsman , they seem as indian jugglers , with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor can any son of mortal woman , for the first time , seat himself amid those hempen intricacies , and while straining his utmost at the oar , bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted , and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings ; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly .\n",
      "\n",
      "yet habit—strange thing !\n",
      "\n",
      "what cannot habit accomplish ? —gayer sallies , more merry mirth , better jokes , and brighter repartees , you never heard over your mahogany , than you will hear over the half , inch white cedar of the whale , boat , when thus hung in hangman's nooses ; and , like the six burghers of calais before king edward , the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death , with a halter around every neck , as you may say .\n",
      "\n",
      "perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line , and lost .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , when the line is darting out , to be seated then in the boat , is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam , engine in full play , when every flying beam , and shaft , and wheel , is grazing you .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is worse ; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils , because the boat is rocking like a cradle , and you are pitched one way and the other , without the slightest warning ; and only by a certain self , adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action , can you escape being made a mazeppa of , and run away with where the all , seeing sun himself could never pierce you out .\n",
      "\n",
      "again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm , is perhaps more awful than the storm itself ; for , indeed , the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm ; and contains it in itself , as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder , and the ball , and the explosion ; so the graceful repose of the line , as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play—this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair .\n",
      "\n",
      "but why say more ?\n",
      "\n",
      "all men live enveloped in whale , lines .\n",
      "\n",
      "all are born with halters round their necks ; but it is only when caught in the swift , sudden turn of death , that mortals realize the silent , subtle , ever , present perils of life .\n",
      "\n",
      "and if you be a philosopher , though seated in the whale , boat , you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror , than though seated before your evening fire with a poker , and not a harpoon , by your side .\n",
      "\n",
      "if to starbuck the apparition of the squid was a thing of portents , to queequeg it was quite a different object .\n",

      "the next day was exceedingly still and sultry , and with nothing special to engage them , the pequod's crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea .\n",

      "for this part of the indian ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground ; that is , it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises , dolphins , flying , fish , and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters , than those off the rio de la plata , or the in , shore ground off peru .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was my turn to stand at the foremast , head ; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds , to and fro i idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air .\n",
      "\n",
      "no resolution could withstand it ; in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness , at last my soul went out of my body ; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will , long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn .\n",

      "and lo !\n",
      "\n",
      "close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate , his broad , glossy back , of an ethiopian hue , glistening in the sun's rays like a mirror .\n",
      "\n",
      "but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea , and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet , the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon .\n",

      "\n",
      "the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill .\n",

      "\n",
      "the slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea , sent back its reflection into every face , so that they all glowed to each other like red men .\n",
      "\n",
      "and all the while , jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale , and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman ; as at every dart , hauling in upon his crooked lance ( by the line attached to it ) , stubb straightened it again and again , by a few rapid blows against the gunwale , then again and again sent it into the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" pull up—pull up ! \"\n",

      "\" pull up ! —close to ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "and the boat ranged along the fish's flank .\n",
      "\n",
      "when reaching far over the bow , stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish , and kept it there , carefully churning and churning , as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed , and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out .\n",
      "\n",
      "but that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish .\n",
      "\n",
      "and now it is struck ; for , starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his \" flurry , \" the monster horribly wallowed in his blood , overwrapped himself in impenetrable , mad , boiling spray , so that the imperilled craft , instantly dropping astern , had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day .\n",
      "\n",
      "and now abating in his flurry , the whale once more rolled out into view ; surging from side to side ; spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout , hole , with sharp , cracking , agonized respirations .\n",
      "\n",
      "at last , gush after gush of clotted red gore , as if it had been the purple lees of red wine , shot into the frighted air ; and falling back again , ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "his heart had burst !\n",
      "\n",
      "\" he's dead , mr. stubb , \" said daggoo .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" yes ; both pipes smoked out ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "and withdrawing his own from his mouth , stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water ; and , for a moment , stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made .\n",
      "\n",
      "a word concerning an incident in the last chapter .\n",
      "\n",
      "according to the invariable usage of the fishery , the whale , boat pushes off from the ship , with the headsman or whale , killer as temporary steersman , and the harpooneer or whale , fastener pulling the foremost oar , the one known as the harpooneer , oar .\n",
      "\n",
      "now it needs a strong , nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish ; for often , in what is called a long dart , the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet .\n",
      "\n",
      "but however prolonged and exhausting the chase , the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost ; indeed , he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest , not only by incredible rowing , but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations ; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's compass , while all the other muscles are strained and half started—what that is none know but those who have tried it .\n",
      "\n",
      "for one , i cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time .\n",
      "\n",
      "in this straining , bawling state , then , with his back to the fish , all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry— \" stand up , and give it to him ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "he now has to drop and secure his oar , turn round on his centre half way , seize his harpoon from the crotch , and with what little strength may remain , he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "no wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood , vessels in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted !\n",
      "\n",
      "again , if the dart be successful , then at the second critical instant , that is , when the whale starts to run , the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft , to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is then they change places ; and the headsman , the chief officer of the little craft , takes his proper station in the bows of the boat .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , i care not who maintains the contrary , but all this is both foolish and unnecessary .\n",
      "\n",
      "the headsman should stay in the bows from first to last ; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance , and no rowing whatever should be expected of him , except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman .\n",
      "\n",
      "i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase ; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery , it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them .\n",
      "\n",
      "to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart , the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness , and not from out of toil .\n",
      "\n",
      "out of the trunk , the branches grow ; out of them , the twigs .\n",
      "\n",
      "so , in productive subjects , grow the chapters .\n",
      "\n",
      "the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is a notched stick of a peculiar form , some two feet in length , which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow , for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon , whose other naked , barbed end slopingly projects from the prow .\n",
      "\n",
      "thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler , who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch , respectively called the first and second irons .\n",
      "\n",
      "but these two harpoons , each by its own cord , are both connected with the line ; the object being this: to dart them both , if possible , one instantly after the other into the same whale ; so that if , in the coming drag , one should draw out , the other may still retain a hold .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is a doubling of the chances .\n",
      "\n",
      "but it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous , violent , convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron , it becomes impossible for the harpooneer , however lightning , like in his movements , to pitch the second iron into him .\n",
      "\n",
      "nevertheless , as the second iron is already connected with the line , and the line is running , hence that weapon must , at all events , be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat , somehow and somewhere ; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands .\n",
      "\n",
      "tumbled into the water , it accordingly is in such cases ; the spare coils of box line ( mentioned in a preceding chapter ) making this feat , in most instances , prudently practicable .\n",
      "\n",
      "but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties .\n",
      "\n",
      "furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard , it thenceforth becomes a dangling , sharp , edged terror , skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale , entangling the lines , or cutting them , and making a prodigious sensation in all directions .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor , in general , is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse .\n",
      "\n",
      "consider , now , how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong , active , and knowing whale ; when owing to these qualities in him , as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise , eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , of course , each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery .\n",
      "\n",
      "all these particulars are faithfully narrated here , as they will not fail to elucidate several most important , however intricate passages , in scenes hereafter to be painted .\n",
      "\n",
      "stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a calm ; so , forming a tandem of three boats , we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod .\n",
      "\n",
      "and now , as we eighteen men with our thirty , six arms , and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers , slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert , sluggish corpse in the sea ; and it seemed hardly to budge at all , except at long intervals ; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , upon the great canal of hang , ho , or whatever they call it , in china , four or five laborers on the foot , path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour ; but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along , as if laden with pig , lead in bulk .\n",
      "\n",
      "darkness came on ; but three lights up and down in the pequod's main , rigging dimly guided our way ; till drawing nearer we saw ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks .\n",
      "\n",
      "vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment , he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night , and then handing his lantern to a seaman , went his way into the cabin , and did not come forward again until morning .\n",
      "\n",
      "though , in overseeing the pursuit of this whale , captain ahab had evinced his customary activity , to call it so ; yet now that the creature was dead , some vague dissatisfaction , or impatience , or despair , seemed working in him ; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain ; and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship , all that would not one jot advance his grand , monomaniac object .\n",
      "\n",
      "very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequod's decks , that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep ; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck , and thrust rattling out of the port , holes .\n",
      "\n",
      "but by those clanking links , the vast corpse itself , not the ship , is to be moored .\n",
      "\n",
      "tied by the head to the stern , and by the tail to the bows , the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel's and seen through the darkness of the night , which obscured the spars and rigging aloft , the two—ship and whale , seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks , whereof one reclines while the other remains standing .\n",
      "\n",
      "* *a little item may as well be related here .\n",
      "\n",
      "the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside , is by the flukes or tail ; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other ( excepting the side , fins ) , its flexibility even in death , causes it to sink low beneath the surface ; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat , in order to put the chain round it .\n",
      "\n",
      "but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small , strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end , and a weight in its middle , while the other end is secured to the ship .\n",
      "\n",
      "by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass , so that now having girdled the whale , the chain is readily made to follow suit ; and being slipped along the body , is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail , at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes .\n",
      "\n",
      "if moody ahab was now all quiescence , at least so far as could be known on deck , stubb , his second mate , flushed with conquest , betrayed an unusual but still good , natured excitement .\n",
      "\n",
      "such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid starbuck , his official superior , quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs .\n",
      "\n",
      "one small , helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb , was soon made strangely manifest .\n",
      "\n",
      "stubb was a high liver ; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate .\n",

      "though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea , fight , sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship's decks , like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved , ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them ; and though , while the valiant butchers over the deck , table are thus cannibally carving each other's live meat with carving , knives all gilded and tasselled , the sharks , also , with their jewel , hilted mouths , are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat ; and though , were you to turn the whole affair upside down , it would still be pretty much the same thing , that is to say , a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties ; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the atlantic , systematically trotting alongside , to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere , or a dead slave to be decently buried ; and though one or two other like instances might be set down , touching the set terms , places , and occasions , when sharks do most socially congregate , and most hilariously feast ; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers , and in gayer or more jovial spirits , than around a dead sperm whale , moored by night to a whaleship at sea .\n",

      "the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe , and the two plump , whitish lobes being withdrawn ( precisely resembling two large puddings ) , they are then mixed with flour , and cooked into a most delectable mess , in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head , which is quite a dish among some epicures ; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures , by continually dining upon calves' brains , by and by get to have a little brains of their own , so as to be able to tell a calf's head from their own heads ; which , indeed , requires uncommon discrimination .\n",

      "\n",
      "whereupon , this accomplished swordsman , warning all hands to stand off , once more makes a scientific dash at the mass , and with a few sidelong , desperate , lunging slicings , severs it completely in twain ; so that while the short lower part is still fast , the long upper strip , called a blanket , piece , swings clear , and is all ready for lowering .\n",
      "\n",
      "the heavers forward now resume their song , and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale , the other is slowly slackened away , and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath , into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber , room .\n",
      "\n",
      "into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket , piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents .\n",
      "\n",
      "and thus the work proceeds ; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously ; both whale and windlass heaving , the heavers singing , the blubber , room gentlemen coiling , the mates scarfing , the ship straining , and all hands swearing occasionally , by way of assuaging the general friction .\n",
      "\n",
      "i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject , the skin of the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "i have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat , and learned naturalists ashore .\n",
      "\n",
      "my original opinion remains unchanged ; but it is only an opinion .\n",
      "\n",
      "the question is , what and where is the skin of the whale ?\n",
      "\n",
      "already you know what his blubber is .\n",
      "\n",
      "that blubber is something of the consistence of firm , close , grained beef , but tougher , more elastic and compact , and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature's skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness , yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption ; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale's body but that same blubber ; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal , if reasonably dense , what can that be but the skin ?\n",
      "\n",
      "true , from the unmarred dead body of the whale , you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin , transparent substance , somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass , only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin ; that is , previous to being dried , when it not only contracts and thickens , but becomes rather hard and brittle .\n",
      "\n",
      "i have several such dried bits , which i use for marks in my whale , books .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is transparent , as i said before ; and being laid upon the printed page , i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence .\n",
      "\n",
      "at any rate , it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles , as you may say .\n",
      "\n",
      "but what i am driving at here is this .\n",
      "\n",
      "that same infinitely thin , isinglass substance , which , i admit , invests the entire body of the whale , is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature , as the skin of the skin , so to speak ; for it were simply ridiculous to say , that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new , born child .\n",
      "\n",
      "but no more of this .\n",
      "\n",
      "assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale ; then , when this skin , as in the case of a very large sperm whale , will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil ; and , when it is considered that , in quantity , or rather weight , that oil , in its expressed state , is only three fourths , and not the entire substance of the coat ; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass , a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that .\n",
      "\n",
      "reckoning ten barrels to the ton , you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale's skin .\n",
      "\n",
      "in life , the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents .\n",
      "\n",
      "almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re , crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array , something like those in the finest italian line engravings .\n",
      "\n",
      "but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned , but seem to be seen through it , as if they were engraved upon the body itself .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor is this all .\n",
      "\n",
      "in some instances , to the quick , observant eye , those linear marks , as in a veritable engraving , but afford the ground for far other delineations .\n",
      "\n",
      "these are hieroglyphical ; that is , if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics , then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion .\n",
      "\n",
      "by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular , i was much struck with a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippi .\n",
      "\n",
      "like those mystic rocks , too , the mystic , marked whale remains undecipherable .\n",
      "\n",
      "this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm whale presents , he not seldom displays the back , and more especially his flanks , effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance , by reason of numerous rude scratches , altogether of an irregular , random aspect .\n",
      "\n",
      "i should say that those new england rocks on the sea , coast , which agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs—i should say , that those rocks must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular .\n",
      "\n",
      "it also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales ; for i have most remarked them in the large , full , grown bulls of the species .\n",
      "\n",
      "a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "it has already been said , that it is stript from him in long pieces , called blanket , pieces .\n",
      "\n",
      "like most sea , terms , this one is very happy and significant .\n",
      "\n",
      "for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane ; or , still better , an indian poncho slipt over his head , and skirting his extremity .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body , that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers , in all seas , times , and tides .\n",
      "\n",
      "what would become of a greenland whale , say , in those shuddering , icy seas of the north , if unsupplied with his cosy surtout ?\n",
      "\n",
      "true , other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters ; but these , be it observed , are your cold , blooded , lungless fish , whose very bellies are refrigerators ; creatures , that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg , as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire ; whereas , like man , the whale has lungs and warm blood .\n",
      "\n",
      "freeze his blood , and he dies .\n",
      "\n",
      "how wonderful is it then—except after explanation—that this great monster , to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man ; how wonderful that he should be found at home , immersed to his lips for life in those arctic waters !\n",
      "\n",
      "where , when seamen fall overboard , they are sometimes found , months afterwards , perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice , as a fly is found glued in amber .\n",

      "but more surprising is it to know , as has been proved by experiment , that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro in summer .\n",

      "squaring her yards , she bore down , ranged abeam under the pequod's lee , and lowered a boat ; it soon drew nigh ; but , as the side , ladder was being rigged by starbuck's order to accommodate the visiting captain , the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat's stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary .\n",
      "\n",
      "it turned out that the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board , and that mayhew , her captain , was fearful of infecting the pequod's company .\n",

      "for , though himself and boat's crew remained untainted , and though his ship was half a rifle , shot off , and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between ; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land , he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the pequod .\n",

      "subject to this , and other the like interruptions now and then , a conversation was sustained between the two parties ; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort .\n",
      "\n",
      "pulling an oar in the jeroboam's boat , was a man of a singular appearance , even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was a small , short , youngish man , sprinkled all over his face with freckles , and wearing redundant yellow hair .\n",

      "according to this account and what was subsequently learned , it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam .\n",

      "his story was this: he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna shakers , where he had been a great prophet ; in their cracked , secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap , door , announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial , which he carried in his vest , pocket ; but , which , instead of containing gunpowder , was supposed to be charged with laudanum .\n",
      "\n",
      "a strange , apostolic whim having seized him , he had left neskyeuna for nantucket , where , with that cunning peculiar to craziness , he assumed a steady , common , sense exterior , and offered himself as a green , hand candidate for the jeroboam's whaling voyage .\n",
      "\n",
      "they engaged him ; but straightway upon the ship's getting out of sight of land , his insanity broke out in a freshet .\n",

      "he published his manifesto , whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar , general of all oceanica .\n",
      "\n",
      "the unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things ; —the dark , daring play of his sleepless , excited imagination , and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium , united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew , with an atmosphere of sacredness .\n",
      "\n",
      "moreover , they were afraid of him .\n",
      "\n",
      "as such a man , however , was not of much practical use in the ship , especially as he refused to work except when he pleased , the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him ; but apprised that that individual's intention was to land him in the first convenient port , the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials—devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition , in case this intention was carried out .\n",
      "\n",
      "so strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew , that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel was sent from the ship , not a man of them would remain .\n",

      "he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated , say or do what he would ; so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship .\n",
      "\n",
      "the consequence of all this was , that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates ; and since the epidemic had broken out , he carried a higher hand than ever ; declaring that the plague , as he called it , was at his sole command ; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure .\n",
      "\n",
      "the sailors , mostly poor devils , cringed , and some of them fawned before him ; in obedience to his instructions , sometimes rendering him personal homage , as to a god .\n",

      "with them he pushed off ; and , after much weary pulling , and many perilous , unsuccessful onsets , he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast .\n",

      "a broad white shadow rose from the sea ; by its quick , fanning motion , temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen .\n",

      "not a chip of the boat was harmed , nor a hair of any oarsman's head ; but the mate for ever sank .\n",

      "\n",
      "\" captain mayhew , stand by now to receive it \" ; and taking the fatal missive from starbuck's hands , he caught it in the slit of the pole , and reached it over towards the boat .\n",
      "\n",
      "but as he did so , the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing ; the boat drifted a little towards the ship's stern ; so that , as if by magic , the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriel's eager hand .\n",
      "\n",
      "he clutched it in an instant , seized the boat , knife , and impaling the letter on it , sent it thus loaded back into the ship .\n",

      "\n",
      "as , after this interlude , the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale , many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the tumultuous business of cutting , in and attending to a whale , there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew .\n",

      "\n",
      "it is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene .\n",
      "\n",
      "we must now retrace our way a little .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back , the blubber , hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates .\n",
      "\n",
      "but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole ?\n",
      "\n",
      "it was inserted there by my particular friend queequeg , whose duty it was , as harpooneer , to descend upon the monster's back for the special purpose referred to .\n",
      "\n",
      "but in very many cases , circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded .\n",
      "\n",
      "the whale , be it observed , lies almost entirely submerged , excepting the immediate parts operated upon .\n",
      "\n",
      "so down there , some ten feet below the level of the deck , the poor harpooneer flounders about , half on the whale and half in the water , as the vast mass revolves like a tread , mill beneath him .\n",
      "\n",
      "on the occasion in question , queequeg figured in the highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes , at least , he appeared to uncommon advantage ; and no one had a better chance to observe him , as will presently be seen .\n",
      "\n",
      "being the savage's bowsman , that is , the person who pulled the bow , oar in his boat ( the second one from forward ) , it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard , scrabble scramble upon the dead whale's back .\n",
      "\n",
      "you have seen italian organ , boys holding a dancing , ape by a long cord .\n",
      "\n",
      "just so , from the ship's steep side , did i hold queequeg down there in the sea , by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey , rope , attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a humorously perilous business for both of us .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , before we proceed further , it must be said that the monkey , rope was fast at both ends ; fast to queequeg's broad canvas belt , and fast to my narrow leather one .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that for better or for worse , we two , for the time , were wedded ; and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more , then both usage and honor demanded , that instead of cutting the cord , it should drag me down in his wake .\n",
      "\n",
      "so , then , an elongated siamese ligature united us .\n",
      "\n",
      "queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother ; nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed .\n",
      "\n",
      "so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then , that while earnestly watching his motions , i seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two ; that my free will had received a mortal wound ; and that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death .\n",
      "\n",
      "therefore , i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in providence ; for its even , handed equity never could have so gross an injustice .\n",
      "\n",
      "and yet still further pondering—while i jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship , which would threaten to jam him—still further pondering , i say , i saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes ; only , in most cases , he , one way or other , has this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals .\n",
      "\n",
      "if your banker breaks , you snap ; if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills , you die .\n",
      "\n",
      "true , you may say that , by exceeding caution , you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life .\n",
      "\n",
      "but handle queequeg's monkey , rope heedfully as i would , sometimes he jerked it so , that i came very near sliding overboard .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor could i possibly forget that , do what i would , i only had the management of one end of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "* *the monkey , rope is found in all whalers ; but it was only in the pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together .\n",
      "\n",
      "this improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than stubb , in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey , rope holder .\n",
      "\n",
      "i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall , from the incessant rolling and swaying of both .\n",
      "\n",
      "but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to .\n",
      "\n",
      "unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night , the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive .\n",
      "\n",
      "and right in among those sharks was queequeg ; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet .\n",
      "\n",
      "a thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale , the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man .\n",
      "\n",
      "nevertheless , it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie , it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them .\n",
      "\n",
      "accordingly , besides the monkey , rope , with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another protection .\n",
      "\n",
      "suspended over the side in one of the stages , tashtego and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whale , spades , wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach .\n",
      "\n",
      "this procedure of theirs , to be sure , was very disinterested and benevolent of them .\n",
      "\n",
      "they meant queequeg's best happiness , i admit ; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him , and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood , muddled water , those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail .\n",
      "\n",
      "but poor queequeg , i suppose , straining and gasping there with that great iron hook—poor queequeg , i suppose , only prayed to his yojo , and gave up his life into the hands of his gods .\n",
      "\n",
      "well , well , my dear comrade and twin , brother , thought i , as i drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it , after all ?\n",
      "\n",
      "are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world ?\n",
      "\n",
      "that unsounded ocean you gasp in , is life ; those sharks , your foes ; those spades , your friends ; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril , poor lad .\n",
      "\n",
      "but courage !\n",
      "\n",
      "there is good cheer in store for you , queequeg .\n",
      "\n",
      "for now , as with blue lips and blood , shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side ; the steward advances , and with a benevolent , consolatory glance hands him—what ?\n",

      "\n",
      "but having plenty of line yet in the tubs , and the whale not sounding very rapidly , they paid out abundance of rope , and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship .\n",
      "\n",
      "for a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical ; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction , and still plied their oars in another , the contending strain threatened to take them under .\n",
      "\n",
      "but it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain .\n",
      "\n",
      "and they stuck to it till they did gain it ; when instantly , a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel , as the strained line , scraping beneath the ship , suddenly rose to view under her bows , snapping and quivering ; and so flinging off its drippings , that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water , while the whale beyond also rose to sight , and once more the boats were free to fly .\n",

      "but the fagged whale abated his speed , and blindly altering his course , went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him , so that they performed a complete circuit .\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "to the nantucketer , they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "as the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads ; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the pequod's side ; and as we may freely go from one to the other , by merely stepping across the deck:—where , i should like to know , will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here ?\n",
      "\n",
      "in the first place , you are struck by the general contrast between these heads .\n",
      "\n",
      "both are massive enough in all conscience ; but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale's which the right whale's sadly lacks .\n",
      "\n",
      "there is more character in the sperm whale's head .\n",
      "\n",
      "as you behold it , you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him , in point of pervading dignity .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the present instance , too , this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit , giving token of advanced age and large experience .\n",
      "\n",
      "in short , he is what the fishermen technically call a \" grey , headed whale . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely , the two most important organs , the eye and the ear .\n",
      "\n",
      "far back on the side of the head , and low down , near the angle of either whale's jaw , if you narrowly search , you will at last see a lashless eye , which you would fancy to be a young colt's eye ; so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes , it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead , no more than he can one exactly astern .\n",
      "\n",
      "in a word , the position of the whale's eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears ; and you may fancy , for yourself , how it would fare with you , did you sideways survey objects through your ears .\n",
      "\n",
      "you would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side , line of sight ; and about thirty more behind it .\n",
      "\n",
      "if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you , with dagger uplifted in broad day , you would not be able to see him , any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind .\n",
      "\n",
      "in a word , you would have two backs , so to speak ; but , at the same time , also , two fronts ( side fronts ) : for what is it that makes the front of a man—what , indeed , but his eyes ?\n",
      "\n",
      "moreover , while in most other animals that i can now think of , the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power , so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain ; the peculiar position of the whale's eyes , effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head , which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys ; this , of course , must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts .\n",
      "\n",
      "the whale , therefore , must see one distinct picture on this side , and another distinct picture on that side ; while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him .\n",
      "\n",
      "man may , in effect , be said to look out on the world from a sentry , box with two joined sashes for his window .\n",
      "\n",
      "but with the whale , these two sashes are separately inserted , making two distinct windows , but sadly impairing the view .\n",
      "\n",
      "this peculiarity of the whale's eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery ; and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes .\n",
      "\n",
      "a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the leviathan .\n",
      "\n",
      "but i must be content with a hint .\n",
      "\n",
      "so long as a man's eyes are open in the light , the act of seeing is involuntary ; that is , he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him .\n",
      "\n",
      "nevertheless , any one's experience will teach him , that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance , it is quite impossible for him , attentively , and completely , to examine any two things—however large or however small—at one and the same instant of time ; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other .\n",
      "\n",
      "but if you now come to separate these two objects , and surround each by a circle of profound darkness ; then , in order to see one of them , in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it , the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness .\n",
      "\n",
      "how is it , then , with the whale ?\n",
      "\n",
      "true , both his eyes , in themselves , must simultaneously act ; but is his brain so much more comprehensive , combining , and subtle than man's , that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects , one on one side of him , and the other in an exactly opposite direction ?\n",
      "\n",
      "if he can , then is it as marvellous a thing in him , as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in euclid .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor , strictly investigated , is there any incongruity in this comparison .\n",
      "\n",
      "it may be but an idle whim , but it has always seemed to me , that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats ; the timidity and liability to queer frights , so common to such whales ; i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition , in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye .\n",
      "\n",
      "if you are an entire stranger to their race , you might hunt over these two heads for hours , and never discover that organ .\n",
      "\n",
      "the ear has no external leaf whatever ; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill , so wondrously minute is it .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is lodged a little behind the eye .\n",
      "\n",
      "with respect to their ears , this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right .\n",
      "\n",
      "while the ear of the former has an external opening , that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane , so as to be quite imperceptible from without .\n",
      "\n",
      "is it not curious , that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye , and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hare's ?\n",
      "\n",
      "but if his eyes were broad as the lens of herschel's great telescope ; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals ; would that make him any longer of sight , or sharper of hearing ?\n",
      "\n",
      "not at all . —why then do you try to \" enlarge \" your mind ?\n",
      "\n",
      "subtilize it .\n",
      "\n",
      "let us now with whatever levers and steam , engines we have at hand , cant over the sperm whale's head , that it may lie bottom up ; then , ascending by a ladder to the summit , have a peep down the mouth ; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it , with a lantern we might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach .\n",
      "\n",
      "but let us hold on here by this tooth , and look about us where we are .\n",
      "\n",
      "what a really beautiful and chaste , looking mouth !\n",
      "\n",
      "from floor to ceiling , lined , or rather papered with a glistening white membrane , glossy as bridal satins .\n",
      "\n",
      "but come out now , and look at this portentous lower jaw , which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff , box , with the hinge at one end , instead of one side .\n",
      "\n",
      "if you pry it up , so as to get it overhead , and expose its rows of teeth , it seems a terrific portcullis ; and such , alas !\n",
      "\n",
      "it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery , upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force .\n",
      "\n",
      "but far more terrible is it to behold , when fathoms down in the sea , you see some sulky whale , floating there suspended , with his prodigious jaw , some fifteen feet long , hanging straight down at right , angles with his body , for all the world like a ship's jib , boom .\n",
      "\n",
      "this whale is not dead ; he is only dispirited ; out of sorts , perhaps ; hypochondriac ; and so supine , that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed , leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight , a reproach to all his tribe , who must , no doubt , imprecate lock , jaws upon him .\n",
      "\n",
      "in most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth , and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles , including canes , umbrella , stocks , and handles to riding , whips .\n",
      "\n",
      "with a long , weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board , as if it were an anchor ; and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other work—queequeg , daggoo , and tashtego , being all accomplished dentists , are set to drawing teeth .\n",
      "\n",
      "with a keen cutting , spade , queequeg lances the gums ; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts , and a tackle being rigged from aloft , they drag out these teeth , as michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands .\n",
      "\n",
      "there are generally forty , two teeth in all ; in old whales , much worn down , but undecayed ; nor filled after our artificial fashion .\n",
      "\n",
      "the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs , and piled away like joists for building houses .\n",
      "\n",
      "crossing the deck , let us now have a good long look at the right whale's head .\n",
      "\n",
      "as in general shape the noble sperm whale's head may be compared to a roman war , chariot ( especially in front , where it is so broadly rounded ) ; so , at a broad view , the right whale's head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot , toed shoe .\n",
      "\n",
      "two hundred years ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker's last .\n",
      "\n",
      "and in this same last or shoe , that old woman of the nursery tale , with the swarming brood , might very comfortably be lodged , she and all her progeny .\n",
      "\n",
      "but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects , according to your point of view .\n",
      "\n",
      "if you stand on its summit and look at these two f , shaped spoutholes , you would take the whole head for an enormous bass , viol , and these spiracles , the apertures in its sounding , board .\n",
      "\n",
      "then , again , if you fix your eye upon this strange , crested , comb , like incrustation on the top of the mass—this green , barnacled thing , which the greenlanders call the \" crown , \" and the southern fishers the \" bonnet \" of the right whale ; fixing your eyes solely on this , you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak , with a bird's nest in its crotch .\n",
      "\n",
      "at any rate , when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet , such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you ; unless , indeed , your fancy has been fixed by the technical term \" crown \" also bestowed upon it ; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea , whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner .\n",
      "\n",
      "but if this whale be a king , he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem .\n",
      "\n",
      "look at that hanging lower lip !\n",
      "\n",
      "what a huge sulk and pout is there !\n",
      "\n",
      "a sulk and pout , by carpenter's measurement , about twenty feet long and five feet deep ; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more .\n",

      "a great pity , now , that this unfortunate whale should be hare , lipped .\n",
      "\n",
      "the fissure is about a foot across .\n",

      "probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast , when earthquakes caused the beach to gape .\n",

      "is this the road that jonah went ?\n",
      "\n",
      "the roof is about twelve feet high , and runs to a pretty sharp angle , as if there were a regular ridge , pole there ; while these ribbed , arched , hairy sides , present us with those wondrous , half vertical , scimetar , shaped slats of whalebone , say three hundred on a side , which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone , form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned .\n",
      "\n",
      "the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres , through which the right whale strains the water , and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish , when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the central blinds of bone , as they stand in their natural order , there are certain curious marks , curves , hollows , and ridges , whereby some whalemen calculate the creature's age , as the age of an oak by its circular rings .\n",
      "\n",
      "though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable , yet it has the savor of analogical probability .\n",

      "at any rate , if we yield to it , we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable .\n",

      "\n",
      "one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous \" whiskers \" inside of the whale's mouth ; * another , \" hogs' bristles \" ; a third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language: \" there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper chop , which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth . \"\n",

      "but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment , and , standing in the right whale's mouth , look around you afresh .\n",
      "\n",
      "seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about , would you not think you were inside of the great haarlem organ , and gazing upon its thousand pipes ?\n",
      "\n",
      "for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest turkey—the tongue , which is glued , as it were , to the floor of the mouth .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is very fat and tender , and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck .\n",
      "\n",
      "this particular tongue now before us ; at a passing glance i should say it was a six , barreler ; that is , it will yield you about that amount of oil .\n",
      "\n",
      "ere this , you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started with—that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely different heads .\n",
      "\n",
      "to sum up , then: in the right whale's there is no great well of sperm ; no ivory teeth at all ; no long , slender mandible of a lower jaw , like the sperm whale's .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor in the sperm whale are there any of those blinds of bone ; no huge lower lip ; and scarcely anything of a tongue .\n",
      "\n",
      "again , the right whale has two external spout , holes , the sperm whale only one .\n",
      "\n",
      "look your last , now , on these venerable hooded heads , while they yet lie together ; for one will soon sink , unrecorded , in the sea ; the other will not be very long in following .\n",
      "\n",
      "can you catch the expression of the sperm whale's there ?\n",
      "\n",
      "it is the same he died with , only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away .\n",
      "\n",
      "i think his broad brow to be full of a prairie , like placidity , born of a speculative indifference as to death .\n",
      "\n",
      "but mark the other head's expression .\n",
      "\n",
      "see that amazing lower lip , pressed by accident against the vessel's side , so as firmly to embrace the jaw .\n",
      "\n",
      "does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death ?\n",
      "\n",
      "this right whale i take to have been a stoic ; the sperm whale , a platonian , who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years .\n",
      "\n",
      "ere quitting , for the nonce , the sperm whale's head , i would have you , as a sensible physiologist , simply—particularly remark its front aspect , in all its compacted collectedness .\n",
      "\n",
      "i would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated , intelligent estimate of whatever battering , ram power may be lodged there .\n",
      "\n",
      "here is a vital point ; for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself , or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling , but not the less true events , perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history .\n",
      "\n",
      "you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale , the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water ; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards , so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom , like lower jaw ; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head , much in the same way , indeed , as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin .\n",
      "\n",
      "moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose ; and that what nose he has—his spout hole—is on the top of his head ; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head , nearly one third of his entire length from the front .\n",
      "\n",
      "wherefore , you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm whale's head is a dead , blind wall , without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever .\n",
      "\n",
      "furthermore , you are now to consider that only in the extreme , lower , backward sloping part of the front of the head , is there the slightest vestige of bone ; and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad .\n",
      "\n",
      "finally , though , as will soon be revealed , its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil ; yet , you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy .\n",
      "\n",
      "in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale , as the rind wraps an orange .\n",
      "\n",
      "just so with the head ; but with this difference: about the head this envelope , though not so thick , is of a boneless toughness , inestimable by any man who has not handled it .\n",
      "\n",
      "the severest pointed harpoon , the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm , impotently rebounds from it .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses' hoofs .\n",
      "\n",
      "i do not think that any sensation lurks in it .\n",
      "\n",
      "bethink yourself also of another thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "when two large , loaded indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks , what do the sailors do ?\n",
      "\n",
      "they do not suspend between them , at the point of coming contact , any merely hard substance , like iron or wood .\n",
      "\n",
      "no , they hold there a large , round wad of tow and cork , enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox , hide .\n",
      "\n",
      "that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow , bars .\n",
      "\n",
      "by itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at .\n",
      "\n",
      "but supplementary to this , it has hypothetically occurred to me , that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them , capable , at will , of distension or contraction ; and as the sperm whale , as far as i know , has no such provision in him ; considering , too , the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface , and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water ; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope ; considering the unique interior of his head ; it has hypothetically occurred to me , i say , that those mystical lung , celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air , so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction .\n",
      "\n",
      "if this be so , fancy the irresistibleness of that might , to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , mark .\n",
      "\n",
      "unerringly impelling this dead , impregnable , uninjurable wall , and this most buoyant thing within ; there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life , only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is—by the cord ; and all obedient to one volition , as the smallest insect .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster ; when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats ; i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity , and be ready to abide by this ; that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien , and mixed the atlantic with the pacific , you would not elevate one hair of your eye , brow .\n",
      "\n",
      "for unless you own the whale , you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth .\n",
      "\n",
      "but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter ; how small the chances for the provincials then ?\n",
      "\n",
      "what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess's veil at lais ?\n",
      "\n",
      "now comes the baling of the case .\n",
      "\n",
      "but to comprehend it aright , you must know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon .\n",
      "\n",
      "regarding the sperm whale's head as a solid oblong , you may , on an inclined plane , sideways divide it into two quoins , * whereof the lower is the bony structure , forming the cranium and jaws , and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones ; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin , and then you have two almost equal parts , which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance .\n",
      "\n",
      "*quoin is not a euclidean term .\n",
      "\n",
      "it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics .\n",
      "\n",
      "i know not that it has been defined before .\n",
      "\n",
      "a quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side , instead of the mutual tapering of both sides .\n",
      "\n",
      "the lower subdivided part , called the junk , is one immense honeycomb of oil , formed by the crossing and recrossing , into ten thousand infiltrated cells , of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent .\n",
      "\n",
      "the upper part , known as the case , may be regarded as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "and as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front , so the whale's vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun .\n",
      "\n",
      "moreover , as that of heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys , so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages ; namely , the highly , prized spermaceti , in its absolutely pure , limpid , and odoriferous state .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature .\n",
      "\n",
      "though in life it remains perfectly fluid , yet , upon exposure to the air , after death , it soon begins to concrete ; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots , as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water .\n",
      "\n",
      "a large whale's case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm , though from unavoidable circumstances , considerable of it is spilled , leaks , and dribbles away , or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can .\n",
      "\n",
      "i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun was coated within , but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl , coloured membrane , like the lining of a fine pelisse , forming the inner surface of the sperm whale's case .\n",
      "\n",
      "it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head ; and since—as has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature , then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale , you have more than twenty , six feet for the depth of the tun , when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship's side .\n",
      "\n",
      "as in decapitating the whale , the operator's instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine ; he has , therefore , to be uncommonly heedful , lest a careless , untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is this decapitated end of the head , also , which is at last elevated out of the water , and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles , whose hempen combinations , on one side , make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter .\n",
      "\n",
      "thus much being said , attend now , i pray you , to that marvellous and—in this particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the sperm whale's great heidelburgh tun is tapped .\n",
      "\n",
      "nimble as a cat , tashtego mounts aloft ; and without altering his erect posture , runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard , arm , to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun .\n",
      "\n",
      "he has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , consisting of only two parts , travelling through a single , sheaved block .\n",
      "\n",
      "securing this block , so that it hangs down from the yard , arm , he swings one end of the rope , till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck .\n",
      "\n",
      "then , hand , over , hand , down the other part , the indian drops through the air , till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head .\n",
      "\n",
      "there—still high elevated above the rest of the company , to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower .\n",
      "\n",
      "a short , handled sharp spade being sent up to him , he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun .\n",
      "\n",
      "in this business he proceeds very heedfully , like a treasure , hunter in some old house , sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in .\n",
      "\n",
      "by the time this cautious search is over , a stout iron , bound bucket , precisely like a well , bucket , has been attached to one end of the whip ; while the other end , being stretched across the deck , is there held by two or three alert hands .\n",
      "\n",
      "these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian , to whom another person has reached up a very long pole .\n",
      "\n",
      "inserting this pole into the bucket , tashtego downward guides the bucket into the tun , till it entirely disappears ; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip , up comes the bucket again , all bubbling like a dairy , maid's pail of new milk .\n",
      "\n",
      "carefully lowered from its height , the full , freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand , and quickly emptied into a large tub .\n",
      "\n",
      "then remounting aloft , it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more .\n",
      "\n",
      "towards the end , tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder , and deeper and deeper into the tun , until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way ; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm ; when all at once a queer accident happened .\n",
      "\n",
      "whether it was that tashtego , that wild indian , was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one , handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head ; or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy ; or whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so , without stating his particular reasons ; how it was exactly , there is no telling now ; but , on a sudden , as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up—my god !\n",
      "\n",
      "poor tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well , dropped head , foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh , and with a horrible oily gurgling , went clean out of sight !\n",
      "\n",
      "\" man overboard ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "cried daggoo , who amid the general consternation first came to his senses .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" swing the bucket this way ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "and putting one foot into it , so as the better to secure his slippery hand , hold on the whip itself , the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head , almost before tashtego could have reached its interior bottom .\n",
      "\n",
      "meantime , there was a terrible tumult .\n",
      "\n",
      "looking over the side , they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea , as if that moment seized with some momentous idea ; whereas it was only the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk .\n",
      "\n",
      "at this instant , while daggoo , on the summit of the head , was clearing the whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a sharp cracking noise was heard ; and to the unspeakable horror of all , one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out , and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung , till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg .\n",
      "\n",
      "the one remaining hook , upon which the entire strain now depended , seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way ; an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" come down , come down ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "yelled the seamen to daggoo , but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles , so that if the head should drop , he would still remain suspended ; the negro having cleared the foul line , rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well , meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it , and so be hoisted out .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" in heaven's name , man , \" cried stubb , \" are you ramming home a cartridge there ? —avast !\n",
      "\n",
      "how will that help him ; jamming that iron , bound bucket on top of his head ?\n",
      "\n",
      "avast , will ye ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" stand clear of the tackle ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket .\n",
      "\n",
      "almost in the same instant , with a thunder , boom , the enormous mass dropped into the sea , like niagara's table , rock into the whirlpool ; the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it , to far down her glittering copper ; and all caught their breath , as half swinging—now over the sailors' heads , and now over the water—daggoo , through a thick mist of spray , was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles , while poor , buried , alive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea !\n",
      "\n",
      "but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away , when a naked figure with a boarding , sword in his hand , was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks .\n",
      "\n",
      "the next , a loud splash announced that my brave queequeg had dived to the rescue .\n",
      "\n",
      "one packed rush was made to the side , and every eye counted every ripple , as moment followed moment , and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen .\n",
      "\n",
      "some hands now jumped into a boat alongside , and pushed a little off from the ship .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" ha !\n",
      "\n",
      "ha ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "cried daggoo , all at once , from his now quiet , swinging perch overhead ; and looking further off from the side , we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves ; a sight strange to see , as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" both !\n",
      "\n",
      "both ! —it is both !\n",
      "\n",
      "\" —cried daggoo again with a joyful shout ; and soon after , queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand , and with the other clutching the long hair of the indian .\n",
      "\n",
      "drawn into the waiting boat , they were quickly brought to the deck ; but tashtego was long in coming to , and queequeg did not look very brisk .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , how had this noble rescue been accomplished ?\n",
      "\n",
      "why , diving after the slowly descending head , queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom , so as to scuttle a large hole there ; then dropping his sword , had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards , and so hauled out poor tash by the head .\n",
      "\n",
      "he averred , that upon first thrusting in for him , a leg was presented ; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be , and might occasion great trouble ; —he had thrust back the leg , and by a dexterous heave and toss , had wrought a somerset upon the indian ; so that with the next trial , he came forth in the good old way—head foremost .\n",
      "\n",
      "as for the great head itself , that was doing as well as could be expected .\n",
      "\n",
      "and thus , through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg , the deliverance , or rather , delivery of tashtego , was successfully accomplished , in the teeth , too , of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments ; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten .\n",
      "\n",
      "midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing , riding and rowing .\n",
      "\n",
      "i know that this queer adventure of the gay , header's will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen , though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore ; an accident which not seldom happens , and with much less reason too than the indian's , considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the sperm whale's well .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , peradventure , it may be sagaciously urged , how is this ?\n",
      "\n",
      "we thought the tissued , infiltrated head of the sperm whale , was the lightest and most corky part about him ; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself .\n",
      "\n",
      "we have thee there .\n",
      "\n",
      "not at all , but i have ye ; for at the time poor tash fell in , the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents , leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded , hammered substance , as i have before said , much heavier than the sea water , and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it , so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed , affording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run , as you may say .\n",
      "\n",
      "yes , it was a running delivery , so it was .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , had tashtego perished in that head , it had been a very precious perishing ; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti ; coffined , hearsed , and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "only one sweeter end can readily be recalled—the delicious death of an ohio honey , hunter , who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree , found such exceeding store of it , that leaning too far over , it sucked him in , so that he died embalmed .\n",
      "\n",
      "how many , think ye , have likewise fallen into plato's honey head , and sweetly perished there ?\n",
      "\n",
      "to scan the lines of his face , or feel the bumps on the head of this leviathan ; this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist has as yet undertaken .\n",
      "\n",
      "such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar , or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the pantheon .\n",
      "\n",
      "still , in that famous work of his , lavater not only treats of the various faces of men , but also attentively studies the faces of horses , birds , serpents , and fish ; and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor have gall and his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man .\n",

      "physiognomically regarded , the sperm whale is an anomalous creature .\n",

      "and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features ; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression ; hence it would seem that its entire absence , as an external appendage , must very largely affect the countenance of the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "for as in landscape gardening , a spire , cupola , monument , or tower of some sort , is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene ; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open , work belfry of the nose .\n",

      "\n",
      "\" stand by , men ; he stirs , \" cried starbuck , as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water , distinctly conducting upwards to them , as by magnetic wires , the life and death throbs of the whale , so that every oarsman felt them in his seat .\n",
      "\n",
      "the next moment , relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows , the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards , as a small icefield will , when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea .\n",

      "\n",
      "the lines , of which , hardly an instant before , not one hand's breadth could have been gained , were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats , and soon the whale broke water within two ship's lengths of the hunters .\n",
      "\n",
      "his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion .\n",
      "\n",
      "in most land animals there are certain valves or flood , gates in many of their veins , whereby when wounded , the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions .\n",
      "\n",
      "not so with the whale ; one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non , valvular structure of the blood , vessels , so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon , a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system ; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface , his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams .\n",
      "\n",
      "yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him , and so distant and numerous its interior fountains , that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period ; even as in a drought a river will flow , whose source is in the well , springs of far , off and undiscernible hills .\n",
      "\n",
      "even now , when the boats pulled upon this whale , and perilously drew over his swaying flukes , and the lances were darted into him , they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound , which kept continually playing , while the natural spout , hole in his head was only at intervals , however rapid , sending its affrighted moisture into the air .\n",
      "\n",
      "from this last vent no blood yet came , because no vital part of him had thus far been struck .\n",
      "\n",
      "his life , as they significantly call it , was untouched .\n",
      "\n",
      "as the boats now more closely surrounded him , the whole upper part of his form , with much of it that is ordinarily submerged , was plainly revealed .\n",
      "\n",
      "his eyes , or rather the places where his eyes had been , were beheld .\n",
      "\n",
      "as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot , holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate , so from the points which the whale's eyes had once occupied , now protruded blind bulbs , horribly pitiable to see .\n",
      "\n",
      "but pity there was none .\n",
      "\n",
      "for all his old age , and his one arm , and his blind eyes , he must die the death and be murdered , in order to light the gay bridals and other merry , makings of men , and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all .\n",
      "\n",
      "still rolling in his blood , at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance , the size of a bushel , low down on the flank .\n",

      "\n",
      "but humane starbuck was too late .\n",
      "\n",
      "at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound , and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish , the whale now spouting thick blood , with swift fury blindly darted at the craft , bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore , capsizing flask's boat and marring the bows .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was his death stroke .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , by this time , so spent was he by loss of blood , that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made ; lay panting on his side , impotently flapped with his stumped fin , then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world ; turned up the white secrets of his belly ; lay like a log , and died .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was most piteous , that last expiring spout .\n",
      "\n",
      "as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain , and with half , stifled melancholy gurglings the spray , column lowers and lowers to the ground—so the last long dying spout of the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "soon , while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship , the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled .\n",
      "\n",
      "immediately , by starbuck's orders , lines were secured to it at different points , so that ere long every boat was a buoy ; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords .\n",
      "\n",
      "by very heedful management , when the ship drew nigh , the whale was transferred to her side , and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke , chains , for it was plain that unless artificially upheld , the body would at once sink to the bottom .\n",
      "\n",
      "it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade , the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh , on the lower part of the bunch before described .\n",
      "\n",
      "but as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales , with the flesh perfectly healed around them , and no prominence of any kind to denote their place ; therefore , there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to .\n",
      "\n",
      "but still more curious was the fact of a lance , head of stone being found in him , not far from the buried iron , the flesh perfectly firm about it .\n",
      "\n",
      "who had darted that stone lance ?\n",
      "\n",
      "and when ?\n",
      "\n",
      "it might have been darted by some nor' west indian long before america was discovered .\n",
      "\n",
      "what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling .\n",
      "\n",
      "but a sudden stop was put to further discoveries , by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea , owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency to sink .\n",
      "\n",
      "however , starbuck , who had the ordering of affairs , hung on to it to the last ; hung on to it so resolutely , indeed , that when at length the ship would have been capsized , if still persisting in locking arms with the body ; then , when the command was given to break clear from it , such was the immovable strain upon the timber , heads to which the fluke , chains and cables were fastened , that it was impossible to cast them off .\n",
      "\n",
      "meantime everything in the pequod was aslant .\n",
      "\n",
      "to cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house .\n",
      "\n",
      "the ship groaned and gasped .\n",
      "\n",
      "many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places , by the unnatural dislocation .\n",
      "\n",
      "in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke , chains , to pry them adrift from the timberheads ; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached , while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk , and the ship seemed on the point of going over .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" hold on , hold on , won't ye ? \"\n",
      "\n",
      "cried stubb to the body , \" don't be in such a devil of a hurry to sink !\n",
      "\n",
      "by thunder , men , we must do something or go for it .\n",
      "\n",
      "no use prying there ; avast , i say with your handspikes , and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen , knife , and cut the big chains . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" knife ?\n",
      "\n",
      "aye , aye , \" cried queequeg , and seizing the carpenter's heavy hatchet , he leaned out of a porthole , and steel to iron , began slashing at the largest fluke , chains .\n",
      "\n",
      "but a few strokes , full of sparks , were given , when the exceeding strain effected the rest .\n",
      "\n",
      "with a terrific snap , every fastening went adrift ; the ship righted , the carcase sank .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing ; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it .\n",
      "\n",
      "usually the dead sperm whale floats with great buoyancy , with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface .\n",
      "\n",
      "if the only whales that thus sank were old , meagre , and broken , hearted creatures , their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic ; then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking , consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him .\n",
      "\n",
      "but it is not so .\n",
      "\n",
      "for young whales , in the highest health , and swelling with noble aspirations , prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life , with all their panting lard about them ; even these brawny , buoyant heroes do sometimes sink .\n",
      "\n",
      "be it said , however , that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species .\n",
      "\n",
      "where one of that sort go down , twenty right whales do .\n",
      "\n",
      "this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale ; his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton ; from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free .\n",
      "\n",
      "but there are instances where , after the lapse of many hours or several days , the sunken whale again rises , more buoyant than in life .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the reason of this is obvious .\n",
      "\n",
      "gases are generated in him ; he swells to a prodigious magnitude ; becomes a sort of animal balloon .\n",
      "\n",
      "a line , of , battle ship could hardly keep him under then .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the shore whaling , on soundings , among the bays of new zealand , when a right whale gives token of sinking , they fasten buoys to him , with plenty of rope ; so that when the body has gone down , they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the pequod's mast , heads , announcing that the jungfrau was again lowering her boats ; though the only spout in sight was that of a fin , back , belonging to the species of uncapturable whales , because of its incredible power of swimming .\n",
      "\n",
      "nevertheless , the fin , back's spout is so similar to the sperm whale's , that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it .\n",
      "\n",
      "and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute .\n",
      "\n",
      "the virgin crowding all sail , made after her four young keels , and thus they all disappeared far to leeward , still in bold , hopeful chase .\n",
      "\n",
      "oh , many are the fin , backs , and many are the dericks , my friend .\n",
      "\n",
      "there are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method .\n",
      "\n",
      "the more i dive into this matter of whaling , and push my researches up to the very spring , head of it so much the more am i impressed with its great honorableness and antiquity ; and especially when i find so many great demi , gods and heroes , prophets of all sorts , who one way or other have shed distinction upon it , i am transported with the reflection that i myself belong , though but subordinately , to so emblazoned a fraternity .\n",
      "\n",
      "the gallant perseus , a son of jupiter , was the first whaleman ; and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said , that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent .\n",
      "\n",
      "those were the knightly days of our profession , when we only bore arms to succor the distressed , and not to fill men's lamp , feeders .\n",
      "\n",
      "every one knows the fine story of perseus and andromeda ; how the lovely andromeda , the daughter of a king , was tied to a rock on the sea , coast , and as leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off , perseus , the prince of whalemen , intrepidly advancing , harpooned the monster , and delivered and married the maid .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was an admirable artistic exploit , rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day ; inasmuch as this leviathan was slain at the very first dart .\n",
      "\n",
      "and let no man doubt this arkite story ; for in the ancient joppa , now jaffa , on the syrian coast , in one of the pagan temples , there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale , which the city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew .\n",
      "\n",
      "when the romans took joppa , the same skeleton was carried to italy in triumph .\n",
      "\n",
      "what seems most singular and suggestively important in this story , is this: it was from joppa that jonah set sail .\n",
      "\n",
      "akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda—indeed , by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous story of st . george and the dragon ; which dragon i maintain to have been a whale ; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together , and often stand for each other .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" thou art as a lion of the waters , and as a dragon of the sea , \" saith ezekiel ; hereby , plainly meaning a whale ; in truth , some versions of the bible use that word itself .\n",
      "\n",
      "besides , it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st . george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land , instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep .\n",
      "\n",
      "any man may kill a snake , but only a perseus , a st . george , a coffin , have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us ; for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffin , like shape , and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback , yet considering the great ignorance of those times , when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists ; and considering that as in perseus' case , st . george's whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach ; and considering that the animal ridden by st . george might have been only a large seal , or sea , horse ; bearing all this in mind , it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene , to hold this so , called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself .\n",
      "\n",
      "in fact , placed before the strict and piercing truth , this whole story will fare like that fish , flesh , and fowl idol of the philistines , dagon by name ; who being planted before the ark of israel , his horse's head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him , and only the stump or fishy part of him remained .\n",
      "\n",
      "thus , then , one of our own noble stamp , even a whaleman , is the tutelary guardian of england ; and by good rights , we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st . george .\n",
      "\n",
      "and therefore , let not the knights of that honorable company ( none of whom , i venture to say , have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron ) , let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain , since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st . george's decoration than they .\n",
      "\n",
      "whether to admit hercules among us or not , concerning this i long remained dubious: for though according to the greek mythologies , that antique crockett and kit carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds , was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale ; still , whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him , that might be mooted .\n",
      "\n",
      "it nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish , unless , indeed , from the inside .\n",
      "\n",
      "nevertheless , he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman ; at any rate the whale caught him , if he did not the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "i claim him for one of our clan .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , by the best contradictory authorities , this grecian story of hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale ; and vice versâ ; certainly they are very similar .\n",
      "\n",
      "if i claim the demi , god then , why not the prophet ?\n",
      "\n",
      "nor do heroes , saints , demigods , and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order .\n",
      "\n",
      "our grand master is still to be named ; for like royal kings of old times , we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves .\n",
      "\n",
      "that wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster , which gives us the dread vishnoo , one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos ; gives us this divine vishnoo himself for our lord ; —vishnoo , who , by the first of his ten earthly incarnations , has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "when brahma , or the god of gods , saith the shaster , resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions , he gave birth to vishnoo , to preside over the work ; but the vedas , or mystical books , whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation , and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects , these vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters ; so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale , and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths , rescued the sacred volumes .\n",
      "\n",
      "was not this vishnoo a whaleman , then ?\n",

      "reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter .\n",
      "\n",
      "now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "but then there were some sceptical greeks and romans , who , standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times , equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale , and arion and the dolphin ; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts , for all that .\n",
      "\n",
      "one old sag , harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the hebrew story was this:—he had one of those quaint old , fashioned bibles , embellished with curious , unscientific plates ; one of which represented jonah's whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the leviathan ( the right whale , and the varieties of that order ) , concerning which the fishermen have this saying , \" a penny roll would choke him \" ; his swallow is so very small .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , to this , bishop jebb's anticipative answer is ready .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is not necessary , hints the bishop , that we consider jonah as tombed in the whale's belly , but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth .\n",
      "\n",
      "and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop .\n",
      "\n",
      "for truly , the right whale's mouth would accommodate a couple of whist , tables , and comfortably seat all the players .\n",
      "\n",
      "possibly , too , jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth ; but , on second thoughts , the right whale is toothless .\n",
      "\n",
      "another reason which sag , harbor ( he went by that name ) urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet , was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices .\n",
      "\n",
      "but this objection likewise falls to the ground , because a german exegetist supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale—even as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents , and crawled into them .\n",
      "\n",
      "besides , it has been divined by other continental commentators , that when jonah was thrown overboard from the joppa ship , he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by , some vessel with a whale for a figure , head ; and , i would add , possibly called \" the whale , \" as some craft are nowadays christened the \" shark , \" the \" gull , \" the \" eagle . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life , preserver—an inflated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to , and so was saved from a watery doom .\n",
      "\n",
      "poor sag , harbor , therefore , seems worsted all round .\n",
      "\n",
      "but he had still another reason for his want of faith .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was this , if i remember right: jonah was swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean sea , and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days' journey of nineveh , a city on the tigris , very much more than three days' journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast .\n",
      "\n",
      "how is that ?\n",
      "\n",
      "but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh ?\n",
      "\n",
      "yes .\n",
      "\n",
      "he might have carried him round by the way of the cape of good hope .\n",
      "\n",
      "but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean , and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea , such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three days , not to speak of the tigris waters , near the site of nineveh , being too shallow for any whale to swim in .\n",
      "\n",
      "besides , this idea of jonah's weathering the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew diaz , its reputed discoverer , and so make modern history a liar .\n",
      "\n",
      "but all these foolish arguments of old sag , harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him , seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "i say it only shows his foolish , impious pride , and abominable , devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy .\n",
      "\n",
      "for by a portuguese catholic priest , this very idea of jonah's going to nineveh via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle .\n",
      "\n",
      "and so it was .\n",
      "\n",
      "besides , to this day , the highly enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah .\n",
      "\n",
      "and some three centuries ago , an english traveller in old harris's voyages , speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah , in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil .\n",
      "\n",
      "to make them run easily and swiftly , the axles of carriages are anointed ; and for much the same purpose , some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat ; they grease the bottom .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm , it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage ; considering that oil and water are hostile ; that oil is a sliding thing , and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely .\n",
      "\n",
      "queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat , and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared , took more than customary pains in that occupation ; crawling under its bottom , where it hung over the side , and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel .\n",
      "\n",
      "he seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor did it remain unwarranted by the event .\n",
      "\n",
      "towards noon whales were raised ; but so soon as the ship sailed down to them , they turned and fled with swift precipitancy ; a disordered flight , as of cleopatra's barges from actium .\n",
      "\n",
      "nevertheless , the boats pursued , and stubb's was foremost .\n",
      "\n",
      "by great exertion , tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron ; but the stricken whale , without at all sounding , still continued his horizontal flight , with added fleetness .\n",
      "\n",
      "such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it .\n",
      "\n",
      "it became imperative to lance the flying whale , or be content to lose him .\n",
      "\n",
      "but to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible , he swam so fast and furious .\n",
      "\n",
      "what then remained ?\n",
      "\n",
      "of all the wondrous devices and dexterities , the sleights of hand and countless subtleties , to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced , none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling .\n",
      "\n",
      "small sword , or broad sword , in all its exercises boasts nothing like it .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale ; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking , jerking boat , under extreme headway .\n",
      "\n",
      "steel and wood included , the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length ; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon , and also of a lighter material—pine .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is furnished with a small rope called a warp , of considerable length , by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting .\n",
      "\n",
      "but before going further , it is important to mention here , that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance , yet it is seldom done ; and when done , is still less frequently successful , on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance , which in effect become serious drawbacks .\n",
      "\n",
      "as a general thing , therefore , you must first get fast to a whale , before any pitchpoling comes into play .\n",
      "\n",
      "look now at stubb ; a man who from his humorous , deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies , was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling .\n",
      "\n",
      "look at him ; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat ; wrapt in fleecy foam , the towing whale is forty feet ahead .\n",
      "\n",
      "handling the long lance lightly , glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight , stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand , so as to secure its free end in his grasp , leaving the rest unobstructed .\n",
      "\n",
      "then holding the lance full before his waistband's middle , he levels it at the whale ; when , covering him with it , he steadily depresses the butt , end in his hand , thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm , fifteen feet in the air .\n",
      "\n",
      "he minds you somewhat of a juggler , balancing a long staff on his chin .\n",
      "\n",
      "next moment with a rapid , nameless impulse , in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance , and quivers in the life spot of the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "instead of sparkling water , he now spouts red blood .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" that drove the spigot out of him ! \"\n",

      "\n",
      "yea , verily , hearts alive , we'd brew choice punch in the spread of his spout , hole there , and from that live punch , bowl quaff the living stuff . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "again and again to such gamesome talk , the dexterous dart is repeated , the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash .\n",
      "\n",
      "the agonized whale goes into his flurry ; the tow , line is slackened , and the pitchpoler dropping astern , folds his hands , and mutely watches the monster die .\n",
      "\n",
      "that for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea , and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep , as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots ; and that for some centuries back , thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale , watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should be , and yet , that down to this blessed minute ( fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o'clock p . m . of this sixteenth day of december , a . d . 1851 ) , it should still remain a problem , whether these spoutings are , after all , really water , or nothing but vapor—this is surely a noteworthy thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "let us , then , look at this matter , along with some interesting items contingent .\n",
      "\n",
      "every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills , the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim ; hence , a herring or a cod might live a century , and never once raise its head above the surface .\n",
      "\n",
      "but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs , like a human being's , the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere .\n",
      "\n",
      "wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world .\n",
      "\n",
      "but he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth , for , in his ordinary attitude , the sperm whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface ; and what is still more , his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth .\n",
      "\n",
      "no , he breathes through his spiracle alone ; and this is on the top of his head .\n",
      "\n",
      "if i say , that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality , inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element , which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle , i do not think i shall err ; though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words .\n",
      "\n",
      "assume it , and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath , he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time .\n",
      "\n",
      "that is to say , he would then live without breathing .\n",
      "\n",
      "anomalous as it may seem , this is precisely the case with the whale , who systematically lives , by intervals , his full hour and more ( when at the bottom ) without drawing a single breath , or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air ; for , remember , he has no gills .\n",
      "\n",
      "how is this ?\n",
      "\n",
      "between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicelli , like vessels , which vessels , when he quits the surface , are completely distended with oxygenated blood .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that for an hour or more , a thousand fathoms in the sea , he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him , just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs .\n",
      "\n",
      "the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable ; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true , seems the more cogent to me , when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out , as the fishermen phrase it .\n",
      "\n",
      "this is what i mean .\n",
      "\n",
      "if unmolested , upon rising to the surface , the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings .\n",
      "\n",
      "say he stays eleven minutes , and jets seventy times , that is , respires seventy breaths ; then whenever he rises again , he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again , to a minute .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him , so that he sounds , he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air .\n",
      "\n",
      "and not till those seventy breaths are told , will he finally go down to stay out his full term below .\n",
      "\n",
      "remark , however , that in different individuals these rates are different ; but in any one they are alike .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out , unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air , ere descending for good ?\n",
      "\n",
      "how obvious is it , too , that this necessity for the whale's rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase .\n",
      "\n",
      "for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught , when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight .\n",
      "\n",
      "not so much thy skill , then , o hunter , as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee !\n",
      "\n",
      "in man , breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for two or three pulsations ; so that whatever other business he has to attend to , waking or sleeping , breathe he must , or die he will .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time .\n",
      "\n",
      "it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout , hole ; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water , then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him ; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout , hole ; and being so clogged with two elements , it could not be expected to have the power of smelling .\n",
      "\n",
      "but owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water or whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head .\n",
      "\n",
      "sure it is , nevertheless , that the sperm whale has no proper olfactories .\n",
      "\n",
      "but what does he want of them ?\n",
      "\n",
      "no roses , no violets , no cologne , water in the sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "furthermore , as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal , and as that long canal—like the grand erie canal—is furnished with a sort of locks ( that open and shut ) for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water , therefore the whale has no voice ; unless you insult him by saying , that when he so strangely rumbles , he talks through his nose .\n",
      "\n",
      "but then again , what has the whale to say ?\n",
      "\n",
      "seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this world , unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living .\n",
      "\n",
      "oh , happy that the world is such an excellent listener !\n",
      "\n",
      "now , the spouting canal of the sperm whale , chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air , and for several feet laid along , horizontally , just beneath the upper surface of his head , and a little to one side ; this curious canal is very much like a gas , pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the question returns whether this gas , pipe is also a water , pipe ; in other words , whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath , or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth , and discharged through the spiracle .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal ; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle .\n",
      "\n",
      "because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be , when in feeding he accidentally takes in water .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the sperm whale's food is far beneath the surface , and there he cannot spout even if he would .\n",
      "\n",
      "besides , if you regard him very closely , and time him with your watch , you will find that when unmolested , there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration .\n",
      "\n",

      "this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping , when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea ; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker , woe to that sailor , whiskers and all .\n",

      "\n",
      "but here be it premised , that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans , the sperm whales , instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies , as in former times , are now frequently met with in extensive herds , sometimes embracing so great a multitude , that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection .\n",
      "\n",
      "to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravans , may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds , you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together , without being greeted by a single spout ; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands .\n",
      "\n",
      "broad on both bows , at the distance of some two or three miles , and forming a great semicircle , embracing one half of the level horizon , a continuous chain of whale , jets were up , playing and sparkling in the noon , day air .\n",

      "unlike the straight perpendicular twin , jets of the right whale , which , dividing at top , fall over in two branches , like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow , the single forward , slanting spout of the sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist , continually rising and falling away to leeward .\n",
      "\n",
      "seen from the pequod's deck , then , as she would rise on a high hill of the sea , this host of vapory spouts , individually curling up into the air , and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze , showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis , descried of a balmy autumnal morning , by some horseman on a height .\n",
      "\n",
      "as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains , accelerate their march , all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear , and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain ; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits ; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle , and swimming on , in one solid , but still crescentic centre .\n",
      "\n",
      "crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them ; the harpooneers handling their weapons , and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats .\n",
      "\n",
      "if the wind only held , little doubt had they , that chased through these straits of sunda , the vast host would only deploy into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number .\n",

      "\n",
      "so with stun , sail piled on stun , sail , we sailed along , driving these leviathans before us ; when , of a sudden , the voice of tashtego was heard , loudly directing attention to something in our wake .\n",
      "\n",
      "corresponding to the crescent in our van , we beheld another in our rear .\n",
      "\n",
      "it seemed formed of detached white vapors , rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales ; only they did not so completely come and go ; for they constantly hovered , without finally disappearing .\n",

      "\n",
      "as if too long lurking behind the headlands , till the pequod should fairly have entered the straits , these rascally asiatics were now in hot pursuit , to make up for their over , cautious delay .\n",
      "\n",
      "but when the swift pequod , with a fresh leading wind , was herself in hot chase ; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit , —mere riding , whips and rowels to her , that they were .\n",
      "\n",
      "as with glass under arm , ahab to , and , fro paced the deck ; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased , and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him ; some such fancy as the above seemed his .\n",
      "\n",
      "and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing , and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance , and beheld , how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end ; and not only that , but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses ; —when all these conceits had passed through his brain , ahab's brow was left gaunt and ribbed , like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it , without being able to drag the firm thing from its place .\n",
      "\n",
      "but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew ; and when , after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern , the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side , emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond ; then , the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship , than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the malays .\n",
      "\n",
      "but still driving on in the wake of the whales , at length they seemed abating their speed ; gradually the ship neared them ; and the wind now dying away , word was passed to spring to the boats .\n",
      "\n",
      "but no sooner did the herd , by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm whale , become notified of the three keels that were after them , —though as yet a mile in their rear , —than they rallied again , and forming in close ranks and battalions , so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets , moved on with redoubled velocity .\n",
      "\n",
      "stripped to our shirts and drawers , we sprang to the white , ash , and after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase , when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution , which , when the fishermen perceive it in the whale , they say he is gallied .\n",
      "\n",
      "the compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming , were now broken up in one measureless rout ; and like king porus' elephants in the indian battle with alexander , they seemed going mad with consternation .\n",
      "\n",
      "in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles , and aimlessly swimming hither and thither , by their short thick spoutings , they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic .\n",
      "\n",
      "this was still more strangely evinced by those of their number , who , completely paralysed as it were , helplessly floated like water , logged dismantled ships on the sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "had these leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep , pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves , they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay .\n",
      "\n",
      "but this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures .\n",
      "\n",
      "though banding together in tens of thousands , the lion , maned buffaloes of the west have fled before a solitary horseman .\n",
      "\n",
      "witness , too , all human beings , how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit , they will , at the slightest alarm of fire , rush helter , skelter for the outlets , crowding , trampling , jamming , and remorselessly dashing each other to death .\n",
      "\n",
      "best , therefore , withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us , for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men .\n",
      "\n",
      "though many of the whales , as has been said , were in violent motion , yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated , but collectively remained in one place .\n",
      "\n",
      "as is customary in those cases , the boats at once separated , each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal .\n",
      "\n",
      "in about three minutes' time , queequeg's harpoon was flung ; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces , and then running away with us like light , steered straight for the heart of the herd .\n",
      "\n",
      "though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances , is in no wise unprecedented ; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated ; yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery .\n",
      "\n",
      "for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal , you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb .\n",
      "\n",
      "as , blind and deaf , the whale plunged forward , as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him ; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea , on all sides menaced as we flew , by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us ; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice , isles in a tempest , and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits , knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed .\n",
      "\n",
      "but not a bit daunted , queequeg steered us manfully ; now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance ; now edging away from that , whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead , while all the time , starbuck stood up in the bows , lance in hand , pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts , for there was no time to make long ones .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor were the oarsmen quite idle , though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with .\n",
      "\n",
      "they chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" out of the way , commodore ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "cried one , to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface , and for an instant threatened to swamp us .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" hard down with your tail , there ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "cried a second to another , which , close to our gunwale , seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan , like extremity .\n",
      "\n",
      "all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances , originally invented by the nantucket indians , called druggs .\n",
      "\n",
      "two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together , so that they cross each other's grain at right angles ; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block , and the other end of the line being looped , it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used .\n",
      "\n",
      "for then , more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time .\n",
      "\n",
      "but sperm whales are not every day encountered ; while you may , then , you must kill all you can .\n",
      "\n",
      "and if you cannot kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure .\n",
      "\n",
      "hence it is , that at times like these the drugg , comes into requisition .\n",
      "\n",
      "our boat was furnished with three of them .\n",
      "\n",
      "the first and second were successfully darted , and we saw the whales staggeringly running off , fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg .\n",
      "\n",
      "they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball .\n",
      "\n",
      "but upon flinging the third , in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block , it caught under one of the seats of the boat , and in an instant tore it out and carried it away , dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from under him .\n",
      "\n",
      "on both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks , but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in , and so stopped the leaks for the time .\n",
      "\n",
      "it had been next to impossible to dart these drugged , harpoons , were it not that as we advanced into the herd , our whale's way greatly diminished ; moreover , that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion , the direful disorders seemed waning .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out , and the towing whale sideways vanished ; then , with the tapering force of his parting momentum , we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal , as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake .\n",
      "\n",
      "here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales , were heard but not felt .\n",
      "\n",
      "in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin , like surface , called a sleek , produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods .\n",
      "\n",
      "yes , we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion .\n",
      "\n",
      "and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles , and saw successive pods of whales , eight or ten in each , swiftly going round and round , like multiplied spans of horses in a ring ; and so closely shoulder to shoulder , that a titanic circus , rider might easily have over , arched the middle ones , and so have gone round on their backs .\n",
      "\n",
      "owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales , more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd , no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us .\n",
      "\n",
      "we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in ; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up .\n",
      "\n",
      "keeping at the centre of the lake , we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves ; the women and children of this routed host .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles , and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles , the entire area at this juncture , embraced by the whole multitude , must have contained at least two or three square miles .\n",
      "\n",
      "at any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon .\n",
      "\n",
      "i mention this circumstance , because , as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold ; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping ; or , possibly , being so young , unsophisticated , and every way innocent and inexperienced ; however it may have been , these smaller whales—now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence , or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at .\n",
      "\n",
      "like household dogs they came snuffling round us , right up to our gunwales , and touching them ; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them .\n",
      "\n",
      "queequeg patted their foreheads ; starbuck scratched their backs with his lance ; but fearful of the consequences , for the time refrained from darting it .\n",

      "but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface , another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , suspended in those watery vaults , floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales , and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers .\n",
      "\n",
      "the lake , as i have hinted , was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent ; and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast , as if leading two different lives at the time ; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment , be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence ; —even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us , but not at us , as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new , born sight .\n",
      "\n",
      "floating on their sides , the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us .\n",

      "he was a little frisky ; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule ; where , tail to head , and all ready for the final spring , the unborn whale lies bent like a tartar's bow .\n",

      "but at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery , this whale had become entangled in the harpoon , line that he towed ; he had also run away with the cutting , spade in him ; and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon , had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon , line round his tail , the cutting , spade itself had worked loose from his flesh .\n",

      "\n",
      "in good time , nevertheless , as the ardour of youth declines ; as years and dumps increase ; as reflection lends her solemn pauses ; in short , as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk ; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens ; our ottoman enters upon the impotent , repentant , admonitory stage of life , forswears , disbands the harem , and grown to an exemplary , sulky old soul , goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers , and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors .\n",

      "for example , —after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale , the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm ; and drifting far away to leeward , be retaken by a second whaler , who , in a calm , snugly tows it alongside , without risk of life or line .\n",

      "alive or dead a fish is technically fast , when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat , by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants , —a mast , an oar , a nine , inch cable , a telegraph wire , or a strand of cobweb , it is all the same .\n",
      "\n",
      "likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif , or any other recognised symbol of possession ; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside , as well as their intention so to do .\n",
      "\n",
      "these are scientific commentaries ; but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the coke , upon , littleton of the fist .\n",
      "\n",
      "true , among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases , where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party .\n",
      "\n",
      "but others are by no means so scrupulous .\n",
      "\n",
      "some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale , trover litigated in england , wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the northern seas ; and when indeed they ( the plaintiffs ) had succeeded in harpooning the fish ; they were at last , through peril of their lives , obliged to forsake not only their lines , but their boat itself .\n",
      "\n",
      "ultimately the defendants ( the crew of another ship ) came up with the whale , struck , killed , seized , and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs .\n",
      "\n",
      "and when those defendants were remonstrated with , their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs' teeth , and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done , he would now retain their line , harpoons , and boat , which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure .\n",
      "\n",
      "wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale , line , harpoons , and boat .\n",
      "\n",
      "mr. erskine was counsel for the defendants ; lord ellenborough was the judge .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the course of the defence , the witty erskine went on to illustrate his position , by alluding to a recent crim .\n",
      "\n",
      "con .\n",
      "\n",
      "case , wherein a gentleman , after in vain trying to bridle his wife's viciousness , had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life ; but in the course of years , repenting of that step , he instituted an action to recover possession of her .\n",
      "\n",
      "erskine was on the other side ; and he then supported it by saying , that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady , and had once had her fast , and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness , had at last abandoned her ; yet abandon her he did , so that she became a loose , fish ; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re , harpooned her , the lady then became that subsequent gentleman's property , along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her .\n",
      "\n",
      "now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other .\n",
      "\n",
      "these pleadings , and the counter pleadings , being duly heard , the very learned judge in set terms decided , to wit , —that as for the boat , he awarded it to the plaintiffs , because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives ; but that with regard to the controverted whale , harpoons , and line , they belonged to the defendants ; the whale , because it was a loose , fish at the time of the final capture ; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them , it ( the fish ) acquired a property in those articles ; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them .\n",
      "\n",
      "now the defendants afterwards took the fish ; ergo , the aforesaid articles were theirs .\n",

      "\n",
      "all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib , booms .\n",
      "\n",
      "now and then pairs of them would drop their work , and run up to the mast , head to get some fresh air .\n",
      "\n",
      "some thinking they would catch the plague , dipped oakum in coal , tar , and at intervals held it to their nostrils .\n",
      "\n",
      "others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl , were vigorously puffing tobacco , smoke , so that it constantly filled their olfactories .\n",
      "\n",
      "stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the captain's round , house abaft ; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door , which was held ajar from within .\n",
      "\n",
      "this was the tormented surgeon , who , after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day , had betaken himself to the captain's round , house ( cabinet he called it ) to avoid the pest ; but still , could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times .\n",
      "\n",
      "marking all this , stubb argued well for his scheme , and turning to the guernsey , man had a little chat with him , during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus , who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle .\n",
      "\n",
      "sounding him carefully , stubb further perceived that the guernsey , man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris .\n",
      "\n",
      "he therefore held his peace on that head , but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him , so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain , without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity .\n",
      "\n",
      "according to this little plan of theirs , the guernsey , man , under cover of an interpreter's office , was to tell the captain what he pleased , but as coming from stubb ; and as for stubb , he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview .\n",
      "\n",
      "by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was a small and dark , but rather delicate looking man for a sea , captain , with large whiskers and moustache , however ; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch , seals at his side .\n",

      "\n",
      "\" he says , monsieur , \" said the guernsey , man , in french , turning to his captain , \" that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel , whose captain and chief , mate , with six sailors , had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside . \"\n",

      "\n",
      "hearing this , the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties ( meaning himself and mate ) and concluded by inviting stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" he wants you to take a glass of wine with him , \" said the interpreter .\n",
      "\n",

      "by this time stubb was over the side , and getting into his boat , hailed the guernsey , man to this effect , —that having a long tow , line in his boat , he would do what he could to help them , by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship's side .\n",
      "\n",
      "while the frenchman's boats , then , were engaged in towing the ship one way , stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way , ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow , line .\n",
      "\n",
      "presently a breeze sprang up ; stubb feigned to cast off from the whale ; hoisting his boats , the frenchman soon increased his distance , while the pequod slid in between him and stubb's whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the floating body , and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intentions , at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning .\n",
      "\n",
      "seizing his sharp boat , spade , he commenced an excavation in the body , a little behind the side fin .\n",
      "\n",
      "you would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea ; and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs , it was like turning up old roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam .\n",

      "\n",
      "stubb was beginning to look disappointed , especially as the horrible nosegay increased , when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague , there stole a faint stream of perfume , which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it , as one river will flow into and then along with another , without at all blending with it for a time .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" i have it , i have it , \" cried stubb , with delight , striking something in the subterranean regions , \" a purse !\n",

      "a purse ! \"\n",

      "dropping his spade , he thrust both hands in , and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe windsor soap , or rich mottled old cheese ; very unctuous and savory withal .\n",

      "you might easily dent it with your thumb ; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour .\n",

      "now this ambergris is a very curious substance , and so important as an article of commerce , that in 1791 a certain nantucket , born captain coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that subject .\n",

      "i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris , certain hard , round , bony plates , which at first stubb thought might be sailors' trowsers buttons ; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner .\n",

      "because those whalemen did not then , and do not now , try out their oil at sea as the southern ships have always done ; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits , thrust it through the bung holes of large casks , and carry it home in that manner ; the shortness of the season in those icy seas , and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed , forbidding any other course .\n",
      "\n",
      "the consequence is , that upon breaking into the hold , and unloading one of these whale cemeteries , in the greenland dock , a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave , yard , for the foundations of a lying , in hospital .\n",
      "\n",
      "i partly surmise also , that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland , in former times , of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg , which latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack , in his great work on smells , a text , book on that subject .\n",
      "\n",
      "as its name imports ( smeer , fat ; berg , to put up ) , this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out , without being taken home to holland for that purpose .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a collection of furnaces , fat , kettles , and oil sheds ; and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor .\n",
      "\n",
      "but all this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler ; which in a voyage of four years perhaps , after completely filling her hold with oil , does not , perhaps , consume fifty days in the business of boiling out ; and in the state that it is casked , the oil is nearly scentless .\n",
      "\n",
      "the truth is , that living or dead , if but decently treated , whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor ; nor can whalemen be recognised , as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew in the company , by the nose .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant , when , as a general thing , he enjoys such high health ; taking abundance of exercise ; always out of doors ; though , it is true , seldom in the open air .\n",
      "\n",
      "i say , that the motion of a sperm whale's flukes above water dispenses a perfume , as when a musk , scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor .\n",
      "\n",
      "what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance , considering his magnitude ?\n",
      "\n",
      "must it not be to that famous elephant , with jewelled tusks , and redolent with myrrh , which was led out of an indian town to do honor to alexander the great ?\n",
      "\n",
      "it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman , that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequod's crew ; an event most lamentable ; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , in the whale ship , it is not every one that goes in the boats .\n",
      "\n",
      "some few hands are reserved called ship , keepers , whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale .\n",
      "\n",
      "as a general thing , these ship , keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats' crews .\n",
      "\n",
      "but if there happen to be an unduly slender , clumsy , or timorous wight in the ship , that wight is certain to be made a ship , keeper .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nick , name , pip by abbreviation .\n",
      "\n",
      "poor pip !\n",
      "\n",
      "ye have heard of him before ; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight , so gloomy , jolly .\n",
      "\n",
      "in outer aspect , pip and dough , boy made a match , like a black pony and a white one , of equal developments , though of dissimilar colour , driven in one eccentric span .\n",
      "\n",
      "but while hapless dough , boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects , pip , though over tender , hearted , was at bottom very bright , with that pleasant , genial , jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe ; a tribe , which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer , freer relish than any other race .\n",
      "\n",
      "for blacks , the year's calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty , five fourth of julys and new year's days .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor smile so , while i write that this little black was brilliant , for even blackness has its brilliancy ; behold yon lustrous ebony , panelled in king's cabinets .\n",
      "\n",
      "but pip loved life , and all life's peaceable securities ; so that the panic , striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped , had most sadly blurred his brightness ; though , as ere long will be seen , what was thus temporarily subdued in him , in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires , that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut , he had once enlivened many a fiddler's frolic on the green ; and at melodious even , tide , with his gay ha , ha !\n",
      "\n",
      "had turned the round horizon into one star , belled tambourine .\n",
      "\n",
      "so , though in the clear air of day , suspended against a blue , veined neck , the pure , watered diamond drop will healthful glow ; yet , when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre , he lays it against a gloomy ground , and then lights it up , not by the sun , but by some unnatural gases .\n",
      "\n",
      "then come out those fiery effulgences , infernally superb ; then the evil , blazing diamond , once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies , looks like some crown , jewel stolen from the king of hell .\n",
      "\n",
      "but let us to the story .\n",
      "\n",
      "it came to pass , that in the ambergris affair stubb's after , oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand , as for a time to become quite maimed ; and , temporarily , pip was put into his place .\n",
      "\n",
      "the first time stubb lowered with him , pip evinced much nervousness ; but happily , for that time , escaped close contact with the whale ; and therefore came off not altogether discreditably ; though stubb observing him , took care , afterwards , to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost , for he might often find it needful .\n",
      "\n",
      "now upon the second lowering , the boat paddled upon the whale ; and as the fish received the darted iron , it gave its customary rap , which happened , in this instance , to be right under poor pip's seat .\n",
      "\n",
      "the involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap , paddle in hand , out of the boat ; and in such a way , that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest , he breasted it overboard with him , so as to become entangled in it , when at last plumping into the water .\n",
      "\n",
      "that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run , the line swiftly straightened ; and presto !\n",
      "\n",
      "poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat , remorselessly dragged there by the line , which had taken several turns around his chest and neck .\n",
      "\n",
      "tashtego stood in the bows .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was full of the fire of the hunt .\n",
      "\n",
      "he hated pip for a poltroon .\n",
      "\n",
      "snatching the boat , knife from its sheath , he suspended its sharp edge over the line , and turning towards stubb , exclaimed interrogatively , \" cut ? \"\n",
      "\n",
      "meantime pip's blue , choked face plainly looked , do , for god's sake !\n",
      "\n",
      "all passed in a flash .\n",
      "\n",
      "in less than half a minute , this entire thing happened .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" damn him , cut ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "roared stubb ; and so the whale was lost and pip was saved .\n",
      "\n",
      "so soon as he recovered himself , the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew .\n",
      "\n",
      "tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate , stubb then in a plain , business , like , but still half humorous manner , cursed pip officially ; and that done , unofficially gave him much wholesome advice .\n",
      "\n",
      "the substance was , never jump from a boat , pip , except—but all the rest was indefinite , as the soundest advice ever is .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , in general , stick to the boat , is your true motto in whaling ; but cases will sometimes happen when leap from the boat , is still better .\n",
      "\n",
      "moreover , as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip , he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future ; stubb suddenly dropped all advice , and concluded with a peremptory command , \" stick to the boat , pip , or by the lord , i won't pick you up if you jump ; mind that .\n",
      "\n",
      "we can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you ; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would , pip , in alabama .\n",
      "\n",
      "bear that in mind , and don't jump any more . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted , that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money , making animal , which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence .\n",
      "\n",
      "but we are all in the hands of the gods ; and pip jumped again .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was under very similar circumstances to the first performance ; but this time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started to run , pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller's trunk .\n",
      "\n",
      "alas !\n",
      "\n",
      "stubb was but too true to his word .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a beautiful , bounteous , blue day ; the spangled sea calm and cool , and flatly stretching away , all round , to the horizon , like gold , beater's skin hammered out to the extremest .\n",
      "\n",
      "bobbing up and down in that sea , pip's ebon head showed like a head of cloves .\n",
      "\n",
      "no boat , knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern .\n",
      "\n",
      "stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him ; and the whale was winged .\n",
      "\n",
      "in three minutes , a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between pip and stubb .\n",
      "\n",
      "out from the centre of the sea , poor pip turned his crisp , curling , black head to the sun , another lonely castaway , though the loftiest and the brightest .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , in calm weather , to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring , carriage ashore .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable .\n",
      "\n",
      "the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity , my god !\n",
      "\n",
      "who can tell it ?\n",
      "\n",
      "mark , how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides .\n",
      "\n",
      "but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate ?\n",
      "\n",
      "no ; he did not mean to , at least .\n",
      "\n",
      "because there were two boats in his wake , and he supposed , no doubt , that they would of course come up to pip very quickly , and pick him up ; though , indeed , such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity , is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances ; and such instances not unfrequently occur ; almost invariably in the fishery , a coward , so called , is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies .\n",
      "\n",
      "but it so happened , that those boats , without seeing pip , suddenly spying whales close to them on one side , turned , and gave chase ; and stubb's boat was now so far away , and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish , that pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably .\n",
      "\n",
      "by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him ; but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot ; such , at least , they said he was .\n",
      "\n",
      "the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up , but drowned the infinite of his soul .\n",
      "\n",
      "not drowned entirely , though .\n",
      "\n",
      "rather carried down alive to wondrous depths , where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes ; and the miser , merman , wisdom , revealed his hoarded heaps ; and among the joyous , heartless , ever , juvenile eternities , pip saw the multitudinous , god , omnipresent , coral insects , that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs .\n",
      "\n",
      "he saw god's foot upon the treadle of the loom , and spoke it ; and therefore his shipmates called him mad .\n",
      "\n",
      "so man's insanity is heaven's sense ; and wandering from all mortal reason , man comes at last to that celestial thought , which , to reason , is absurd and frantic ; and weal or woe , feels then uncompromised , indifferent as his god .\n",
      "\n",
      "for the rest , blame not stubb too hardly .\n",
      "\n",
      "the thing is common in that fishery ; and in the sequel of the narrative , it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself .\n",
      "\n",
      "that whale of stubb's , so dearly purchased , was duly brought to the pequod's side , where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed , were regularly gone through , even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun , or case .\n",
      "\n",
      "while some were occupied with this latter duty , others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs , so soon as filled with the sperm ; and when the proper time arrived , this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the try , works , of which anon .\n",
      "\n",
      "it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree , that when , with several others , i sat down before a large constantine's bath of it , i found it strangely concreted into lumps , here and there rolling about in the liquid part .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "such an abounding , affectionate , friendly , loving feeling did this avocation beget ; that at last i was continually squeezing their hands , and looking up into their eyes sentimentally ; as much as to say , —oh , my dear fellow beings , why should we longer cherish any social acerbities , or know the slightest ill , humor or envy !\n",

      "\n",
      "they look much like blocks of berkshire marble .\n",
      "\n",
      "plum , pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale's flesh , here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber , and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is a most refreshing , convivial , beautiful object to behold .\n",
      "\n",
      "as its name imports , it is of an exceedingly rich , mottled tint , with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground , dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple .\n",
      "\n",
      "it is plums of rubies , in pictures of citron .\n",
      "\n",
      "spite of reason , it is hard to keep yourself from eating it .\n",
      "\n",
      "i confess , that once i stole behind the foremast to try it .\n",
      "\n",
      "it tasted something as i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted , supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season , and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne .\n",

      "there is another substance , and a very singular one , which turns up in the course of this business , but which i feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe .\n",

      "it is called slobgollion ; an appellation original with the whalemen , and even so is the nature of the substance .\n",

      "\n",
      "gurry , so called , is a term properly belonging to right whalemen , but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen .\n",

      "edgewise moved along the oily deck , it operates like a leathern squilgee ; and by nameless blandishments , as of magic , allures along with it all impurities .\n",

      "a stark , bewildered feeling , as of death , came over me .\n",
      "\n",

      "how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night , and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee !\n",
      "\n",
      "look not too long in the face of the fire , o man !\n",

      "never dream with thy hand on the helm !\n",

      "ere the english ship fades from sight , be it set down here , that she hailed from london , and was named after the late samuel enderby , merchant of that city , the original of the famous whaling house of enderby & sons ; a house which in my poor whaleman's opinion , comes not far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons , in point of real historical interest .\n",
      "\n",
      "how long , prior to the year of our lord 1775 , this great whaling house was in existence , my numerous fish , documents do not make plain ; but in that year ( 1775 ) it fitted out the first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale ; though for some score of years previous ( ever since 1726 ) our valiant coffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleets pursued that leviathan , but only in the north and south atlantic: not elsewhere .\n",
      "\n",
      "be it distinctly recorded here , that the nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale ; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him .\n",
      "\n",
      "in 1778 , a fine ship , the amelia , fitted out for the express purpose , and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys , boldly rounded cape horn , and was the first among the nations to lower a whale , boat of any sort in the great south sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "the voyage was a skilful and lucky one ; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm , the amelia's example was soon followed by other ships , english and american , and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were thrown open .\n",
      "\n",
      "but not content with this good deed , the indefatigable house again bestirred itself: samuel and all his sons—how many , their mother only knows—and under their immediate auspices , and partly , i think , at their expense , the british government was induced to send the sloop , of , war rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "commanded by a naval post , captain , the rattler made a rattling voyage of it , and did some service ; how much does not appear .\n",
      "\n",
      "but this is not all .\n",
      "\n",
      "in 1819 , the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own , to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan .\n",
      "\n",
      "that ship—well called the \" syren \" —made a noble experimental cruise ; and it was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known .\n",
      "\n",
      "the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a captain coffin , a nantucketer .\n",
      "\n",
      "all honor to the enderbies , therefore , whose house , i think , exists to the present day ; though doubtless the original samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world .\n",
      "\n",
      "the ship named after him was worthy of the honor , being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way .\n",
      "\n",
      "i boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast , and drank good flip down in the forecastle .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a fine gam we had , and they were all trumps—every soul on board .\n",
      "\n",
      "a short life to them , and a jolly death .\n",
      "\n",
      "and that fine gam i had—long , very long after old ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel—it minds me of the noble , solid , saxon hospitality of that ship ; and may my parson forget me , and the devil remember me , if i ever lose sight of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "flip ?\n",
      "\n",
      "did i say we had flip ?\n",
      "\n",
      "yes , and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour ; and when the squall came ( for it's squally off there by patagonia ) , and all hands—visitors and all—were called to reef topsails , we were so top , heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines ; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails , so that we hung there , reefed fast in the howling gale , a warning example to all drunken tars .\n",
      "\n",
      "however , the masts did not go overboard ; and by and by we scrambled down , so sober , that we had to pass the flip again , though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle , rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste .\n",
      "\n",
      "the beef was fine—tough , but with body in it .\n",
      "\n",
      "they said it was bull , beef ; others , that it was dromedary beef ; but i do not know , for certain , how that was .\n",
      "\n",
      "they had dumplings too ; small , but substantial , symmetrically globular , and indestructible dumplings .\n",
      "\n",
      "i fancied that you could feel them , and roll them about in you after they were swallowed .\n",
      "\n",
      "if you stooped over too far forward , you risked their pitching out of you like billiard , balls .\n",
      "\n",
      "the bread—but that couldn't be helped ; besides , it was an anti , scorbutic ; in short , the bread contained the only fresh fare they had .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the forecastle was not very light , and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it .\n",
      "\n",
      "but all in all , taking her from truck to helm , considering the dimensions of the cook's boilers , including his own live parchment boilers ; fore and aft , i say , the samuel enderby was a jolly ship ; of good fare and plenty ; fine flip and strong ; crack fellows all , and capital from boot heels to hat , band .\n",
      "\n",
      "but why was it , think ye , that the samuel enderby , and some other english whalers i know of—not all though—were such famous , hospitable ships ; that passed round the beef , and the bread , and the can , and the joke ; and were not soon weary of eating , and drinking , and laughing ?\n",
      "\n",
      "i will tell you .\n",
      "\n",
      "the abounding good cheer of these english whalers is matter for historical research .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research , when it has seemed needed .\n",
      "\n",
      "the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders , zealanders , and danes ; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery ; and what is yet more , their fat old fashions , touching plenty to eat and drink .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , as a general thing , the english merchant , ship scrimps her crew ; but not so the english whaler .\n",
      "\n",
      "hence , in the english , this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural , but incidental and particular ; and , therefore , must have some special origin , which is here pointed out , and will be still further elucidated .\n",
      "\n",
      "during my researches in the leviathanic histories , i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume , which , by the musty whaling smell of it , i knew must be about whalers .\n",
      "\n",
      "the title was , \" dan coopman , \" wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery , as every whale ship must carry its cooper .\n",
      "\n",
      "i was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one \" fitz swackhammer . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "but my friend dr . snodhead , a very learned man , professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and st . pott's , to whom i handed the work for translation , giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble—this same dr . snodhead , so soon as he spied the book , assured me that \" dan coopman \" did not mean \" the cooper , \" but \" the merchant . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "in short , this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland ; and , among other subjects , contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery .\n",
      "\n",
      "and in this chapter it was , headed , \" smeer , \" or \" fat , \" that i found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of dutch whalemen ; from which list , as translated by dr . snodhead , i transcribe the following: 400 , 000 lbs .\n",
      "\n",
      "of beef .\n",
      "\n",
      "60 , 000 lbs .\n",
      "\n",
      "friesland pork .\n",
      "\n",
      "150 , 000 lbs .\n",
      "\n",
      "of stock fish .\n",
      "\n",
      "550 , 000 lbs .\n",
      "\n",
      "of biscuit .\n",
      "\n",
      "72 , 000 lbs .\n",
      "\n",
      "of soft bread .\n",
      "\n",
      "2 , 800 firkins of butter .\n",
      "\n",
      "20 , 000 lbs .\n",
      "\n",
      "texel & leyden cheese .\n",
      "\n",
      "144 , 000 lbs .\n",
      "\n",
      "cheese ( probably an inferior article ) .\n",
      "\n",
      "550 ankers of geneva .\n",
      "\n",
      "10 , 800 barrels of beer .\n",
      "\n",
      "most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading ; not so in the present case , however , where the reader is flooded with whole pipes , barrels , quarts , and gills of good gin and good cheer .\n",
      "\n",
      "at the time , i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer , beef , and bread , during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me , capable of a transcendental and platonic application ; and , furthermore , i compiled supplementary tables of my own , touching the probable quantity of stock , fish , etc . , consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery .\n",
      "\n",
      "in the first place , the amount of butter , and texel and leyden cheese consumed , seems amazing .\n",
      "\n",
      "i impute it , though , to their naturally unctuous natures , being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation , and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas , on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil .\n",
      "\n",
      "the quantity of beer , too , is very large , 10 , 800 barrels .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate , so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen , including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea , did not much exceed three months , say , and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail , we have 5 , 400 low dutch seamen in all ; therefore , i say , we have precisely two barrels of beer per man , for a twelve weeks' allowance , exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , whether these gin and beer harpooneers , so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been , were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat's head , and take good aim at flying whales ; this would seem somewhat improbable .\n",
      "\n",
      "yet they did aim at them , and hit them too .\n",
      "\n",
      "but this was very far north , be it remembered , where beer agrees well with the constitution ; upon the equator , in our southern fishery , beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast , head and boozy in his boat ; and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford .\n",
      "\n",
      "but no more ; enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers ; and that the english whalers have not neglected so excellent an example .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , say they , when cruising in an empty ship , if you can get nothing better out of the world , get a good dinner out of it , at least .\n",
      "\n",
      "and this empties the decanter .\n",
      "\n",
      "hitherto , in descriptively treating of the sperm whale , i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect ; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features .\n",
      "\n",
      "but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him , it behooves me now to unbutton him still further , and untagging the points of his hose , unbuckling his garters , and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones , set him before you in his ultimatum ; that is to say , in his unconditional skeleton .\n",
      "\n",
      "but how now , ishmael ?\n",
      "\n",
      "how is it , that you , a mere oarsman in the fishery , pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale ?\n",
      "\n",
      "did erudite stubb , mounted upon your capstan , deliver lectures on the anatomy of the cetacea ; and by help of the windlass , hold up a specimen rib for exhibition ?\n",

      "explain thyself , ishmael .\n",

      "a veritable witness have you hitherto been , ishmael ; but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone ; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams ; the rafters , ridge , pole , sleepers , and under , pinnings , making up the frame , work of leviathan ; and belike of the tallow , vats , dairy , rooms , butteries , and cheeseries in his bowels .\n",
      "\n",
      "i confess , that since jonah , few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale ; nevertheless , i have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature .\n",
      "\n",
      "in a ship i belonged to , a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag , to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons , and for the heads of the lances .\n",
      "\n",
      "think you i let that chance go , without using my boat , hatchet and jack , knife , and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub ?\n",
      "\n",
      "and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic , full grown development , for that rare knowledge i am indebted to my late royal friend tranquo , king of tranque , one of the arsacides .\n",
      "\n",
      "for being at tranque , years ago , when attached to the trading , ship dey of algiers , i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with the lord of tranque , at his retired palm villa at pupella ; a sea , side glen not very far distant from what our sailors called bamboo , town , his capital .\n",
      "\n",
      "among many other fine qualities , my royal friend tranquo , being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu , had brought together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent ; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices , chiselled shells , inlaid spears , costly paddles , aromatic canoes ; and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders , the wonder , freighted , tribute , rendering waves had cast upon his shores .\n",
      "\n",
      "chief among these latter was a great sperm whale , which , after an unusually long raging gale , had been found dead and stranded , with his head against a cocoa , nut tree , whose plumage , like , tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet .\n",
      "\n",
      "when the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathom , deep enfoldings , and the bones become dust dry in the sun , then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen , where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it .\n",
      "\n",
      "the ribs were hung with trophies ; the vertebræ were carved with arsacidean annals , in strange hieroglyphics ; in the skull , the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame , so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout ; while , suspended from a bough , the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees , like the hair , hung sword that so affrighted damocles .\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a wondrous sight .\n",
      "\n",
      "the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen ; the trees stood high and haughty , feeling their living sap ; the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver's loom , with a gorgeous carpet on it , whereof the ground , vine tendrils formed the warp and woof , and the living flowers the figures .\n",
      "\n",
      "all the trees , with all their laden branches ; all the shrubs , and ferns , and grasses ; the message , carrying air ; all these unceasingly were active .\n",

      "\n",
      "according to a careful calculation i have made , and which i partly base upon captain scoresby's estimate , of seventy tons for the largest sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length ; according to my careful calculation , i say , a sperm whale of the largest magnitude , between eighty , five and ninety feet in length , and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference , such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons ; so that , reckoning thirteen men to a ton , he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants .\n",
      "\n",
      "think you not then that brains , like yoked cattle , should be put to this leviathan , to make him at all budge to any landsman's imagination ?\n",
      "\n",
      "having already in various ways put before you his skull , spout , hole , jaw , teeth , tail , forehead , fins , and divers other parts , i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones .\n",
      "\n",
      "but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton ; as it is by far the most complicated part ; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter , you must not fail to carry it in your mind , or under your arm , as we proceed , otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view .\n",
      "\n",
      "in length , the sperm whale's skeleton at tranque measured seventy , two feet ; so that when fully invested and extended in life , he must have been ninety feet long ; for in the whale , the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body .\n",
      "\n",
      "of this seventy , two feet , his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet , leaving some fifty feet of plain back , bone .\n",
      "\n",
      "attached to this back , bone , for something less than a third of its length , was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals .\n",
      "\n",
      "to me this vast ivory , ribbed chest , with the long , unrelieved spine , extending far away from it in a straight line , not a little resembled the hull of a great ship new , laid upon the stocks , when only some twenty of her naked bow , ribs are inserted , and the keel is otherwise , for the time , but a long , disconnected timber .\n",
      "\n",
      "the ribs were ten on a side .\n",
      "\n",
      "the first , to begin from the neck , was nearly six feet long ; the second , third , and fourth were each successively longer , till you came to the climax of the fifth , or one of the middle ribs , which measured eight feet and some inches .\n",
      "\n",
      "from that part , the remaining ribs diminished , till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches .\n",
      "\n",
      "in general thickness , they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length .\n",
      "\n",
      "the middle ribs were the most arched .\n",
      "\n",
      "in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams .\n",
      "\n",
      "in considering these ribs , i could not but be struck anew with the circumstance , so variously repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form .\n",
      "\n",
      "the largest of the tranque ribs , one of the middle ones , occupied that part of the fish which , in life , is greatest in depth .\n",

      "now , the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet ; whereas , the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part .\n",
      "\n",
      "besides , for some way , where i now saw but a naked spine , all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh , muscle , blood , and bowels .\n",
      "\n",
      "still more , for the ample fins , i here saw but a few disordered joints ; and in place of the weighty and majestic , but boneless flukes , an utter blank !\n",
      "\n",
      "how vain and foolish , then , thought i , for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale , by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton , stretched in this peaceful wood .\n",
      "\n",
      "no .\n",
      "\n",
      "only in the heart of quickest perils ; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes ; only on the profound unbounded sea , can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the spine .\n",
      "\n",
      "for that , the best way we can consider it is , with a crane , to pile its bones high up on end .\n",
      "\n",
      "no speedy enterprise .\n",
      "\n",
      "but now it's done , it looks much like pompey's pillar .\n",
      "\n",
      "there are forty and odd vertebræ in all , which in the skeleton are not locked together .\n",
      "\n",
      "they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a gothic spire , forming solid courses of heavy masonry .\n",
      "\n",
      "the largest , a middle one , is in width something less than three feet , and in depth more than four .\n",
      "\n",
      "the smallest , where the spine tapers away into the tail , is only two inches in width , and looks something like a white billiard , ball .\n",
      "\n",
      "i was told that there were still smaller ones , but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins , the priest's children , who had stolen them to play marbles with .\n",
      "\n",
      "thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple child's play .\n",
      "\n",
      "from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge , amplify , and generally expatiate .\n",
      "\n",
      "would you , you could not compress him .\n",
      "\n",
      "by good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio .\n",
      "\n",
      "not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail , and the yards he measures about the waist ; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines , where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop , deck of a line , of , battle , ship .\n",
      "\n",
      "since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan , it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise ; not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood , and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels .\n",
      "\n",

      "but upon investigation we find , that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system ( embracing a distinct geological period prior to man ) , but of the whales found in that tertiary system , those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones .\n",

      "assuredly , we must conclude so , if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as pliny , and the ancient naturalists generally .\n",

      "though so short a period ago—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in illinois exceeded the census of men now in london , and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region ; and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man ; yet the far different nature of the whale , hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan .\n",

      "whereas , in the days of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west , when the far west ( in whose sunset suns still rise ) was a wilderness and a virgin , the same number of moccasined men , for the same number of months , mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships , would have slain not forty , but forty thousand and more buffaloes ; a fact that , if need were , could be statistically stated .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor , considered aright , does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale , for example , that in former years ( the latter part of the last century , say ) these leviathans , in small pods , were encountered much oftener than at present , and , in consequence , the voyages were not so prolonged , and were also much more remunerative .\n",
      "\n",
      "because , as has been elsewhere noticed , those whales , influenced by some views to safety , now swim the seas in immense caravans , so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries , yokes , and pods , and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated , unfrequent armies .\n",

      "\n",
      "for they are only being driven from promontory to cape ; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets , then , be sure , some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle .\n",

      "furthermore: concerning these last mentioned leviathans , they have two firm fortresses , which , in all human probability , will for ever remain impregnable .\n",
      "\n",
      "and as upon the invasion of their valleys , the frosty swiss have retreated to their mountains ; so , hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas , the whale , bone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels , and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there , come up among icy fields and floes ; and in a charmed circle of everlasting december , bid defiance to all pursuit from man .\n",
      "\n",
      "but as perhaps fifty of these whale , bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot , some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions .\n",
      "\n",
      "but though for some time past a number of these whales , not less than 13 , 000 , have been annually slain on the nor' west coast by the americans alone ; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter .\n",
      "\n",
      "natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe , yet what shall we say to harto , the historian of goa , when he tells us that at one hunting the king of siam took 4 , 000 elephants ; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes .\n",
      "\n",
      "and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants , which have now been hunted for thousands of years , by semiramis , by porus , by hannibal , and by all the successive monarchs of the east—if they still survive there in great numbers , much more may the great whale outlast all hunting , since he has a pasture to expatiate in , which is precisely twice as large as all asia , both americas , europe and africa , new holland , and all the isles of the sea combined .\n",
      "\n",
      "moreover: we are to consider , that from the presumed great longevity of whales , their probably attaining the age of a century and more , therefore at any one period of time , several distinct adult generations must be contemporary .\n",
      "\n",
      "and what that is , we may soon gain some idea of , by imagining all the grave , yards , cemeteries , and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men , women , and children who were alive seventy , five years ago ; and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe .\n",

      "the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel enderby of london , had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person .\n",
      "\n",
      "he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half , splintering shock .\n",
      "\n",
      "and when after gaining his own deck , and his own pivot , hole there , he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman ( it was , as ever , something about his not steering inflexibly enough ) ; then , the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench , that though it still remained entire , and to all appearances lusty , yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy .\n",
      "\n",
      "and , indeed , it seemed small matter for wonder , that for all his pervading , mad recklessness , ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood .\n",
      "\n",
      "for it had not been very long prior to the pequod's sailing from nantucket , that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground , and insensible ; by some unknown , and seemingly inexplicable , unimaginable casualty , his ivory limb having been so violently displaced , that it had stake , wise smitten , and all but pierced his groin ; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured .\n",
      "\n",
      "nor , at the time , had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind , that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe ; and he too plainly seemed to see , that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove ; so , equally with every felicity , all miserable events do naturally beget their like .\n",
      "\n",
      "yea , more than equally , thought ahab ; since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , not to hint of this: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings , that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world , but , on the contrary , shall be followed by the joy , childlessness of all hell's despair ; whereas , some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave ; not at all to hint of this , there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing .\n",
      "\n",
      "for , thought ahab , while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them , but , at bottom , all heartwoes , a mystic significance , and , in some men , an archangelic grandeur ; so do their diligent tracings , out not belie the obvious deduction .\n",
      "\n",
      "to trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries , carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods ; so that , in the face of all the glad , hay , making suns , and soft cymballing , round harvest , moons , we must needs give in to this: that the gods themselves are not for ever glad .\n",

      "\n",
      "with many other particulars concerning ahab , always had it remained a mystery to some , why it was , that for a certain period , both before and after the sailing of the pequod , he had hidden himself away with such grand , lama , like exclusiveness ; and , for that one interval , sought speechless refuge , as it were , among the marble senate of the dead .\n",
      "\n",
      "captain peleg's bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate ; though , indeed , as touching all ahab's deeper part , every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , in the end , it all came out ; this one matter did , at least .\n",
      "\n",
      "that direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness .\n",
      "\n",
      "and not only this , but to that ever , contracting , dropping circle ashore , who , for any reason , possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him ; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty—remaining , as it did , moodily unaccounted for by ahab—invested itself with terrors , not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that , through their zeal for him , they had all conspired , so far as in them lay , to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others ; and hence it was , that not till a considerable interval had elapsed , did it transpire upon the pequod's decks .\n",
      "\n",
      "but be all this as it may ; let the unseen , ambiguous synod in the air , or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire , have to do or not with earthly ahab , yet , in this present matter of his leg , he took plain practical procedures ; —he called the carpenter .\n",
      "\n",
      "and when that functionary appeared before him , he bade him without delay set about making a new leg , and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw , ivory ( sperm whale ) which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage , in order that a careful selection of the stoutest , clearest , grained stuff might be secured .\n",
      "\n",
      "this done , the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night ; and to provide all the fittings for it , independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use .\n",
      "\n",
      "moreover , the ship's forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold ; and , to accelerate the affair , the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed .\n",
      "\n",
      "seat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn , and take high abstracted man alone ; and he seems a wonder , a grandeur , and a woe .\n",
      "\n",
      "but from the same point , take mankind in mass , and for the most part , they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates , both contemporary and hereditary .\n",
      "\n",
      "but most humble though he was , and far from furnishing an example of the high , humane abstraction ; the pequod's carpenter was no duplicate ; hence , he now comes in person on this stage .\n",
      "\n",
      "like all sea , going ship carpenters , and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels , he was , to a certain off , handed , practical extent , alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own ; the carpenter's pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material .\n",
      "\n",
      "but , besides the application to him of the generic remark above , this carpenter of the pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship , upon a three or four years' voyage , in uncivilized and far , distant seas .\n",
      "\n",
      "for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties:—repairing stove boats , sprung spars , reforming the shape of clumsy , bladed oars , inserting bull's eyes in the deck , or new tree , nails in the side planks , and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business ; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes , both useful and capricious .\n",
      "\n",
      "the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold , was his vice , bench ; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices , of different sizes , and both of iron and of wood .\n",
      "\n",
      "at all times except when whales were alongside , this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the try , works .\n",
      "\n",
      "a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever , ready vices , and straightway files it smaller .\n",
      "\n",
      "a lost land , bird of strange plumage strays on board , and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of right , whale bone , and cross , beams of sperm whale ivory , the carpenter makes a pagoda , looking cage for it .\n",
      "\n",
      "an oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion .\n",
      "\n",
      "stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar ; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood , the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation .\n",
      "\n",
      "a sailor takes a fancy to wear shark , bone ear , rings: the carpenter drills his ears .\n",
      "\n",
      "another has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers , and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there ; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation ; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice , the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that , if he would have him draw the tooth .\n",
      "\n",
      "thus , this carpenter was prepared at all points , and alike indifferent and without respect in all .\n",
      "\n",
      "teeth he accounted bits of ivory ; heads he deemed but top , blocks ; men themselves he lightly held for capstans .\n",
      "\n",
      "but while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him , too ; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence .\n",
      "\n",
      "but not precisely so .\n",
      "\n",
      "for nothing was this man more remarkable , than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were ; impersonal , i say ; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things , that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world ; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes , still eternally holds its peace , and ignores you , though you dig foundations for cathedrals .\n",
      "\n",
      "yet was this half , horrible stolidity in him , involving , too , as it appeared , an all , ramifying heartlessness ; —yet was it oddly dashed at times , with an old , crutch , like , antediluvian , wheezing humorousness , not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness ; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah's ark .\n",
      "\n",
      "was it that this old carpenter had been a life , long wanderer , whose much rolling , to and fro , not only had gathered no moss ; but what is more , had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him ?\n",
      "\n",
      "he was a stript abstract ; an unfractioned integral ; uncompromised as a new , born babe ; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next .\n",
      "\n",
      "you might almost say , that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence ; for in his numerous trades , he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct , or simply because he had been tutored to it , or by any intermixture of all these , even or uneven ; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb , spontaneous literal process .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was a pure manipulator ; his brain , if he had ever had one , must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers .\n",
      "\n",
      "he was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful , multum in parvo , sheffield contrivances , assuming the exterior—though a little swelled—of a common pocket knife ; but containing , not only blades of various sizes , but also screw , drivers , cork , screws , tweezers , awls , pens , rulers , nail , filers , countersinkers .\n",
      "\n",
      "so , if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw , driver , all they had to do was to open that part of him , and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers , take him up by the legs , and there they were .\n",

      "\n",
      "such an added , gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now ; such ceaseless shudderings shook him ; that the men looked dubious at him ; half uncertain , as it seemed , whether indeed he were a mortal substance , or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being's body .\n",

      "\n",
      "the clothes that the night had wet , the next day's sunshine dried upon him ; and so , day after day , and night after night ; he went no more beneath the planks ; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for .\n",
      "\n",
      "he ate in the same open air ; that is , his two only meals , —breakfast and dinner: supper he never touched ; nor reaped his beard ; which darkly grew all gnarled , as unearthed roots of trees blown over , which still grow idly on at naked base , though perished in the upper verdure .\n",
      "\n",
      "but though his whole life was now become one watch on deck ; and though the parsee's mystic watch was without intermission as his own ; yet these two never seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary .\n",
      "\n",
      "though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain ; openly , and to the awe , struck crew , they seemed pole , like asunder .\n",
      "\n",
      "if by day they chanced to speak one word ; by night , dumb men were both , so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange .\n",
      "\n",
      "at times , for longest hours , without a single hail , they stood far parted in the starlight ; ahab in his scuttle , the parsee by the mainmast ; but still fixedly gazing upon each other ; as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow , in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance .\n",
      "\n",
      "and yet , somehow , did ahab—in his own proper self , as daily , hourly , and every instant , commandingly revealed to his subordinates , —ahab seemed an independent lord ; the parsee but his slave .\n",
      "\n",
      "still again both seemed yoked together , and an unseen tyrant driving them ; the lean shade siding the solid rib .\n",
      "\n",
      "for be this parsee what he may , all rib and keel was solid ahab .\n",
      "\n",
      "at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn , his iron voice was heard from aft , — \" man the mast , heads !\n",
      "\n",
      "\" —and all through the day , till after sunset and after twilight , the same voice every hour , at the striking of the helmsman's bell , was heard— \" what d'ye see ? —sharp !\n",
      "\n",
      "sharp ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "but when three or four days had slided by , after meeting the children , seeking rachel ; and no spout had yet been seen ; the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity ; at least , of nearly all except the pagan harpooneers ; he seemed to doubt , even , whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought .\n",
      "\n",
      "but if these suspicions were really his , he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them , however his actions might seem to hint them .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" i will have the first sight of the whale myself , \" —he said .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" aye !\n",
      "\n",
      "ahab must have the doubloon ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines ; and sending a hand aloft , with a single sheaved block , to secure to the main , mast head , he received the two ends of the downward , reeved rope ; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end , in order to fasten it at the rail .\n",
      "\n",
      "this done , with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin , he looked round upon his crew , sweeping from one to the other ; pausing his glance long upon daggoo , queequeg , tashtego ; but shunning fedallah ; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate , said , — \" take the rope , sir—i give it into thy hands , starbuck . \"\n",
      "\n",
      "then arranging his person in the basket , he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch , starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last ; and afterwards stood near it .\n",
      "\n",
      "and thus , with one hand clinging round the royal mast , ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles , —ahead , astern , this side , and that , —within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height .\n",
      "\n",
      "when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging , which chances to afford no foothold , the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot , and sustained there by the rope ; under these circumstances , its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it .\n",
      "\n",
      "because in such a wilderness of running rigging , whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck ; and when the deck , ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings , it would be but a natural fatality , if , unprovided with a constant watchman , the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "so ahab's proceedings in this matter were not unusual ; the only strange thing about them seemed to be , that starbuck , almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision—one of those too , whose faithfulness on the look , out he had seemed to doubt somewhat ; —it was strange , that this was the very man he should select for his watchman ; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's hands .\n",
      "\n",
      "now , the first time ahab was perched aloft ; ere he had been there ten minutes ; one of those red , billed savage sea , hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast , heads of whalemen in these latitudes ; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings .\n",
      "\n",
      "then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air ; then spiralized downwards , and went eddying again round his head .\n",
      "\n",
      "but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon , ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird ; nor , indeed , would any one else have marked it much , it being no uncommon circumstance ; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" your hat , your hat , sir ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "suddenly cried the sicilian seaman , who being posted at the mizen , mast , head , stood directly behind ahab , though somewhat lower than his level , and with a deep gulf of air dividing them .\n",
      "\n",
      "but already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes ; the long hooked bill at his head: with a scream , the black hawk darted away with his prize .\n",
      "\n",
      "an eagle flew thrice round tarquin's head , removing his cap to replace it , and thereupon tanaquil , his wife , declared that tarquin would be king of rome .\n",
      "\n",
      "but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good .\n",
      "\n",
      "ahab's hat was never restored ; the wild hawk flew on and on with it ; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared ; while from the point of that disappearance , a minute black spot was dimly discerned , falling from that vast height into the sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "the intense pequod sailed on ; the rolling waves and days went by ; the life , buoy , coffin still lightly swung ; and another ship , most miserably misnamed the delight , was descried .\n",
      "\n",
      "as she drew nigh , all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams , called shears , which , in some whaling , ships , cross the quarter , deck at the height of eight or nine feet ; serving to carry the spare , unrigged , or disabled boats .\n",
      "\n",
      "upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered , white ribs , and some few splintered planks , of what had once been a whale , boat ; but you now saw through this wreck , as plainly as you see through the peeled , half , unhinged , and bleaching skeleton of a horse .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" hast seen the white whale ? \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" look ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "replied the hollow , cheeked captain from his taffrail ; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" hast killed him ? \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that , \" answered the other , sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck , whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" not forged ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "and snatching perth's levelled iron from the crotch , ahab held it out , exclaiming— \" look ye , nantucketer ; here in this hand i hold his death !\n",
      "\n",
      "tempered in blood , and tempered by lightning are these barbs ; and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin , where the white whale most feels his accursed life ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "\" then god keep thee , old man—see'st thou that \" —pointing to the hammock— \" i bury but one of five stout men , who were alive only yesterday ; but were dead ere night .\n",
      "\n",
      "only that one i bury ; the rest were buried before they died ; you sail upon their tomb . \"\n",

      "\n",
      "place the plank then on the rail , and lift the body ; so , then—oh , god \" —advancing towards the hammock with uplifted hands— \" may the resurrection and the life—— \" \" brace forward !\n",

      "up helm ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "cried ahab like lightning to his men .\n",
      "\n",
      "but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea ; not so quick , indeed , but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism .\n",
      "\n",
      "as ahab now glided from the dejected delight , the strange life , buoy hanging at the pequod's stern came into conspicuous relief .\n",

      "yonder !\n",

      "look yonder , men ! \"\n",

      "cried a foreboding voice in her wake .\n",
      "\n",
      "\" in vain , oh , ye strangers , ye fly our sad burial ; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin ! \"\n",
      "\n",
      "it was a clear steel , blue day .\n",
      "\n",
      "the firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all , pervading azure ; only , the pensive air was transparently pure and soft , with a woman's look , and the robust and man , like sea heaved with long , strong , lingering swells , as samson's chest in his sleep .\n",
      "\n",
      "hither , and thither , on high , glided the snow , white wings of small , unspeckled birds ; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air ; but to and fro in the deeps , far down in the bottomless blue , rushed mighty leviathans , sword , fish , and sharks ; and these were the strong , troubled , murderous thinkings of the masculine sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "but though thus contrasting within , the contrast was only in shades and shadows without ; those two seemed one ; it was only the sex , as it were , that distinguished them .\n",
      "\n",
      "aloft , like a royal czar and king , the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea ; even as bride to groom .\n",
      "\n",
      "and at the girdling line of the horizon , a soft and tremulous motion—most seen here at the equator—denoted the fond , throbbing trust , the loving alarms , with which the poor bride gave her bosom away .\n",
      "\n",
      "tied up and twisted ; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles ; haggardly firm and unyielding ; his eyes glowing like coals , that still glow in the ashes of ruin ; untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn ; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's forehead of heaven .\n",

      "slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle , ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze , the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity .\n",

      "now , by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis , its bow , by anticipation , was made to face the whale's head while yet under water .\n",

      "but as if perceiving this stratagem , moby dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , sidelingly transplanted himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat .\n",
      "\n",
      "through and through ; through every plank and each rib , it thrilled for an instant , the whale obliquely lying on his back , in the manner of a biting shark , slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth , so that the long , narrow , scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air , and one of the teeth caught in a row , lock .\n",
      "\n",
      "the bluish pearl , white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahab's head , and reached higher than that .\n",

      "\n",
      "with unastonished eyes fedallah gazed , and crossed his arms ; but the tiger , yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the uttermost stern .\n",
      "\n",
      "and now , while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out , as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way ; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat , he could not be darted at from the bows , for the bows were almost inside of him , as it were ; and while the other boats involuntarily paused , as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand , then it was that monomaniac ahab , furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe , which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated ; frenzied with all this , he seized the long bone with his naked hands , and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe .\n",
      "\n",
      "as now he thus vainly strove , the jaw slipped from him ; the frail gunwales bent in , collapsed , and snapped , as both jaws , like an enormous shears , sliding further aft , bit the craft completely in twain , and locked themselves fast again in the sea , midway between the two floating wrecks .\n",
      "\n",
      "these floated aside , the broken ends drooping , the crew at the stern , wreck clinging to the gunwales , and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across .\n",
      "\n",
      "at that preluding moment , ere the boat was yet snapped , ahab , the first to perceive the whale's intent , by the crafty upraising of his head , a movement that loosed his hold for the time ; at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite .\n",
      "\n",
      "but only slipping further into the whale's mouth , and tilting over sideways as it slipped , the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw ; spilled him out of it , as he leaned to the push ; and so he fell flat , faced upon the sea .\n",
      "\n",
      "ripplingly withdrawing from his prey , moby dick now lay at a little distance , vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows ; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body ; so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet out of the water—the now rising swells , with all their confluent waves , dazzlingly broke against it ; vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air .\n",

      "\n",
      "for such is the wonderful skill , prescience of experience , and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket commanders ; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried , they will , under certain given circumstances , pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time , while out of sight , as well as his probable rate of progression during that period .\n",
      "\n",
      "and , in these cases , somewhat as a pilot , when about losing sight of a coast , whose general trending he well knows , and which he desires shortly to return to again , but at some further point ; like as this pilot stands by his compass , and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible , in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote , unseen headland , eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman , at his compass , with the whale ; for after being chased , and diligently marked , through several hours of daylight , then , when night obscures the fish , the creature's future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter , as the pilot's coast is to him .\n",
      "\n",
      "so that to this hunter's wondrous skill , the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water , a wake , is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land .\n",
      "\n",
      "and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace , that , with watches in their hands , men time his rate as doctors that of a baby's pulse ; and lightly say of it , the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot , at such or such an hour ; even so , almost , there are occasions when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep , according to the observed humor of his speed ; and say to themselves , so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles , will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude .\n",
      "\n",
      "but to render this acuteness at all successful in the end , the wind and the sea must be the whaleman's allies ; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety , three leagues and a quarter from his port ?\n",

      "ahab's boat was central ; and cheering his men , he told them he would take the whale head , and , head , —that is , pull straight up to his forehead , —a not uncommon thing ; for when within a certain limit , such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision .\n",
      "\n",
      "but ere that close limit was gained , and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his eye ; the white whale churning himself into furious speed , almost in an instant as it were , rushing among the boats with open jaws , and a lashing tail , offered appalling battle on every side ; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat , seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made .\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "but at last in his untraceable evolutions , the white whale so crossed and recrossed , and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him , that they foreshortened , and , of themselves , warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him ; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little , as if to rally for a more tremendous charge .\n",
      "\n",
      "seizing that opportunity , ahab first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo ! —a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks !\n",

      "\n",
      "that instant , the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines ; by so doing , irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flask towards his flukes ; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf , beaten beach , and then , diving down into the sea , disappeared in a boiling maelstrom , in which , for a space , the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round , like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch .\n",
      "\n",
      "while the two crews were yet circling in the waters , reaching out after the revolving line , tubs , oars , and other floating furniture , while aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial , twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks ; and stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up ; and while the old man's line—now parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could ; —in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils , —ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wires , —as , arrow , like , shooting perpendicularly from the sea , the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom , and sent it , turning over and over , into the air ; till it fell again—gunwale downwards—and ahab and his men struggled out from under it , like seals from a sea , side cave .\n",
      "\n",
      "the first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its direction as he struck the surface—involuntarily launched him along it , to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made ; and with his back to it , he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side ; and whenever a stray oar , bit of plank , the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin , his tail swiftly drew back , and came sideways smiting the sea .\n",
      "\n",

      "some sprained shoulders , wrists , and ankles ; livid contusions ; wrenched harpoons and lances ; inextricable intricacies of rope ; shattered oars and planks ; all these were there ; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one .\n",
